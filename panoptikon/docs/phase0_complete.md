## 2. Quality Checks and Configuration

The following quality checks have been configured:

### Black (Code Formatting)
- Configured with a line length of 120 characters
- Enforces consistent code style across the project
- Integrated with pre-commit hooks

### Ruff (Fast Linting)
- Combines multiple linting tools into a single fast linter
- Configured with extensive rule sets:
  - E: pycodestyle errors
  - F: pyflakes
  - B: flake8-bugbear
  - I: isort (import sorting)
  - D: pydocstyle (docstring style)
  - UP: pyupgrade
  - N: pep8-naming
  - C4: flake8-comprehensions
  - SIM: flake8-simplify
- Google-style docstring convention enforced
- Maximum complexity of 10 per function

### MyPy (Type Checking)
- Strict type checking enforced
- Disallows untyped definitions and decorators
- Warns about returning Any and unused configurations
- Configured for Python 3.9 compatibility

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Trailing whitespace check and removal
- End-of-file fixer for consistent file endings
- YAML and JSON syntax validation
- Check for large files (max 500KB)
- Python syntax validation
- Merge conflict detection
- Private key detection
- Line ending normalization
- File length checks (500 lines max)
- Docstring coverage validation

### Testing and Coverage
- Pytest configuration with coverage reporting
- Minimum 80% coverage requirement
- Organized test structure mirroring the main package
- Test fixtures for filesystem, database, and application components

## 3. Running Tests and Quality Checks

### Running Tests
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd panoptikon

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=src/panoptikon --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# Run tests for a specific module
pytest tests/test_utils/
```

### Running Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Run linting with Ruff
ruff check --fix .

# Run type checking with MyPy
mypy .

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Installing Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

   - Optimize for performance with large file systems

2. **Database Layer**
   - Finalize the database schema
   - Implement efficient querying patterns
   - Add support for index optimization
   - Create database migration capabilities

3. **Search Functionality**
   - Implement the search algorithm
   - Add support for advanced search syntax
   - Create result ranking and sorting
   - Optimize search performance

4. **Basic UI**
   - Implement the main application window
   - Create search input and results display
   - Add basic user preferences
   - Ensure smooth macOS integration

### Technical Goals for Phase 1

- Complete and working indexing system
- Functional search capabilities

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Continued quality enforcement

## 6. Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Project Structure Organization**
   - Challenge: Balancing simplicity with extensibility
   - Solution: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

2. **Quality Tool Integration**
   - Challenge: Integrating multiple tools without conflicts
   - Solution: Carefully configured tools with compatible settings

3. **Type Checking with External Libraries**
   - Challenge: Handling type annotations for external libraries
   - Solution: Appropriate use of type ignores and stubs where needed

4. **Cross-Platform Considerations**
   - Challenge: Supporting different platforms with consistent behavior
   - Solution: Platform-specific code paths with common interfaces

5. **PyObjC Integration**
   - Challenge: Integrating native UI while maintaining testability
   - Solution: Clear separation between UI and business logic

### Approach to Quality

The project follows the "Land Rover philosophy" of simplicity, robustness, and fitness for purpose:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, readable code with clear responsibilities
2. **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and testing
3. **Fitness for Purpose**: Focus on the core functionality of fast file search

This is achieved through:
- Strong typing with MyPy
- Consistent code style with Black
- Comprehensive linting with Ruff
- Thorough testing with pytest
- Docstring coverage enforcement
- Automated quality checks via pre-commit hooks
