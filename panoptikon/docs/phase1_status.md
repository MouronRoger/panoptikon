# Phase 1 Status: MVP Implementation

This document outlines the current status and implementation plan for Phase 1 of the Panoptikon project.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: MVP Implementation**

Phase 1 follows the successful completion of Phase 0 (Project Bootstrapping) and focuses on implementing the core functionality of the Panoptikon application.

## Component Implementation List

### 1. File Indexing System

The file indexing system will be responsible for efficiently discovering, cataloging, and monitoring files across the filesystem.

**Required Features:**
- Fast file system traversal for initial indexing
- Real-time monitoring of file system changes
- Efficient storage of file metadata
- Support for excluding specific directories/files
- Handling of large file systems with minimal resource usage

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Complete the file system crawler implementation
- Implement the watchdog-based file system monitor
- Create the indexing logic with optimization for large directories
- Implement metadata extraction for files
- Add configuration options for exclusion patterns

### 2. Database Schema and Operations

The database layer will store and manage the file index data for fast retrieval during searches.

**Required Features:**
- Efficient schema for storing file information
- Fast query capabilities for search operations
- Transaction support for consistent updates
- Optimization for SSD storage
- Backup and recovery capabilities

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Finalize the SQLAlchemy models for file data
- Implement efficient query patterns
- Create database migration capabilities
- Optimize indexing for common search patterns
- Add database maintenance utilities

### 3. Basic Search Functionality

The search functionality will enable users to quickly find files based on various criteria.

**Required Features:**
- Instantaneous search across the file index
- Support for filename and path searching
- Basic filtering options (file type, size, date)
- Advanced query syntax support
- Result ranking and sorting

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Implement the core search algorithm
- Create the query parser for advanced syntax
- Add support for various filtering options
- Implement result ranking based on relevance
- Optimize search performance for large indexes

### 4. Terminal Interface

The terminal interface will provide a command-line way to interact with the Panoptikon application.

**Required Features:**
- Command-line interface for searches
- Display of search results in the terminal
- Configuration management via CLI
- Status commands for index information
- Export capabilities for search results

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Implement the CLI using Click
- Create formatted output using Rich
- Add command-line options for all search features
- Implement configuration management commands
- Add status reporting and diagnostics

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

All Phase 1 implementations must adhere to the following standards:

1. **Comprehensive Type Annotations**
   - All functions and methods must have complete type annotations
   - Complex types should use appropriate typing constructs (Union, Optional, etc.)

2. **Documentation**
   - All public APIs must have Google-style docstrings
   - Module-level docstrings should explain the component's purpose and design
   - Include examples for non-trivial functionality

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement appropriate error handling for all operations
   - Use custom exception types where appropriate
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize for both speed and memory efficiency
   - Include performance considerations in code comments
   - Profile code for potential bottlenecks

### Testing Requirements

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Minimum 80% test coverage for all modules
   - Critical paths should have 100% coverage

2. **Test Types**
   - Unit tests for individual functions and methods
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Parameterized tests for comprehensive coverage
   - Performance tests for critical operations

3. **Test Fixtures**
   - Create realistic test fixtures for filesystem operations
   - Implement mock databases for testing without filesystem impact
   - Share common fixtures through conftest.py

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Breakdown**
   - Break each component into smaller, manageable tasks
   - Prioritize tasks based on dependencies

2. **Implementation Order**
   - Database schema implementation first
   - File indexing system second
   - Search functionality third
   - Terminal interface last

3. **Review Process**
   - Code reviews for all implementations
   - Performance reviews for critical components
   - Documentation reviews for clarity and completeness

## Quality Expectations

Phase 1 implementations must maintain the project's quality standards:

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow Black formatting with 120 character line length
   - Adhere to the linting rules configured in Ruff
   - Meet all MyPy type checking requirements

2. **Performance**
   - Fast indexing performance even with large file systems
   - Search results should be nearly instantaneous
   - Minimal resource usage during idle monitoring

3. **Robustness**
   - Graceful handling of errors and edge cases
   - Resilience to unexpected filesystem changes
   - Proper cleanup of resources

4. **Usability**
   - Intuitive command-line interface
   - Clear and helpful error messages
   - Consistent behavior across operations

## Timeline

- Component 1 (Database Schema): 3-5 days
- Component 2 (File Indexing): 5-7 days
- Component 3 (Search Functionality): 3-5 days
- Component 4 (Terminal Interface): 2-3 days
- Testing and Refinement: 3-5 days

Total estimated time for Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
