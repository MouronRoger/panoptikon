# Project Status

## Current Phase: Phase 0 - Project Bootstrapping

The project is currently in the initial bootstrapping phase, focusing on setting up the foundation for quality-driven development.

## Implementation Status

The following components have been set up:

### Project Structure
- Directory structure established following the project specifications
- Main package modules created (index, search, ui, db, cloud, config, utils)
- Test directories mirroring the package structure

### Quality Tools
- Black configuration for code formatting
- Ruff for fast linting and code quality checks
- MyPy for static type checking
- Pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
- Test coverage configuration with minimum 80% requirement

### Documentation
- README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines and quality standards
- Initial project status documentation

## Next Steps for Phase 1

The next phase will focus on implementing the core functionality:

1. **File System Indexing**
   - Create a file system crawler to discover files
   - Implement a high-performance indexing system
   - Add real-time file system monitoring using watchdog

2. **Database Layer**
   - Design and implement the database schema
   - Create efficient data access patterns
   - Implement caching for performance optimization

3. **Search Functionality**
   - Develop the search algorithm with various filtering options
   - Implement fuzzy search capabilities
   - Create a query parser for advanced search syntax

4. **Basic UI**
   - Implement a minimal but functional UI using PyObjC
   - Create search result display components
   - Add basic user preference handling

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Need to optimize indexing for large file systems
   - Balance memory usage with search speed

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Current focus is on macOS but architecture should support future Windows/Linux ports

3. **Testing**
   - Need to create robust test fixtures for file system operations
   - Mock database for testing without real file system impact

## Timeline

- Phase 0 (Bootstrapping): Completed
- Phase 1 (Core Functionality): Estimated 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2 (UI Enhancement): To follow Phase 1
- Phase 3 (Cloud Integration): To follow Phase 2

## Blockers

None currently identified.
