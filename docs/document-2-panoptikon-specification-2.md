# Panoptikon: Fast File Search Application
## Requirements Specification Document

**Document Version:** 1.1

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
Panoptikon is a high-performance, lightweight file search application that enables users to instantly find files by name across their entire system. The application directly emulates the Windows "Everything" search utility for macOS and other platforms, with special emphasis on cloud storage integration. Following the "Land Rover philosophy" of simplicity, robustness, and fitness for purpose, Panoptikon prioritizes reliability and core functionality over feature complexity.

### 1.2 Target Platforms
The application should be developed for desktop environments. While the reference implementation is for macOS, proposals for Windows, Linux, or cross-platform solutions are welcome if they meet the core performance and functionality requirements.
