# Phase 1: MVP Implementation Status

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: MVP Implementation**

This phase focuses on implementing the core functionality of Panoptikon, building upon the foundation established in Phase 0. The goal is to create a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the key features needed for basic file searching functionality.

## Component List to be Implemented

### 1. File Indexing System
The indexing system is responsible for discovering and tracking files on the file system.

**Files to Implement:**
- `src/panoptikon/index/monitor.py`: File system change monitoring using watchdog
- `src/panoptikon/index/exclusion.py`: Pattern-based exclusion management
- `src/panoptikon/index/metadata.py`: File metadata extraction

**Key Features:**
- Recursive directory crawling
- Real-time file system monitoring
- Configurable exclusion patterns
- Metadata extraction (file size, type, modification time)

### 2. Database Schema and Operations
The database component will handle persistent storage of the file index.

**Files to Implement:**
- `src/panoptikon/db/operations.py`: CRUD operations for file records
- `src/panoptikon/db/migrations.py`: Schema version management
- `src/panoptikon/db/connection.py`: Connection management and pooling

**Key Features:**
- SQLAlchemy ORM models
- Efficient batch operations
- Migration support for schema changes
- Connection pooling for performance

### 3. Basic Search Functionality
The search component will enable users to find files based on various criteria.

**Files to Implement:**
- `src/panoptikon/search/query.py`: Query parsing and processing
- `src/panoptikon/search/filters.py`: Search filter implementation
- `src/panoptikon/search/ranker.py`: Result ranking algorithms

**Key Features:**
- Filename and path searching
- Content type filtering
- Date-based filtering
- Result ranking by relevance

### 4. Terminal Interface
A basic terminal UI for interacting with the search functionality.

**Files to Implement:**
- `src/panoptikon/ui/terminal.py`: Terminal-based user interface
- `src/panoptikon/ui/commands.py`: Command handling
- `src/panoptikon/ui/formatting.py`: Output formatting

**Key Features:**
- Command-line interface
- Search result display
- Basic configuration management
- Interactive mode

## Required Features

The Phase 1 implementation must include the following features:

1. **File Discovery**:
   - Crawl specified directories recursively
   - Extract basic file metadata
   - Apply exclusion patterns

2. **Change Detection**:
   - Monitor file system for changes
   - Update index when files are created, modified, or deleted
   - Handle file moves and renames

3. **Database Storage**:
   - Store file paths and metadata
   - Efficient query capabilities
   - Transaction support

4. **Search Capabilities**:
   - Search by filename or path
   - Filter by file type
   - Filter by modification date
   - Sort results by relevance

5. **User Interface**:
   - Command-line search functionality
   - Display of search results
   - Configuration management

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality

All code must adhere to the quality standards established in Phase 0:

- Follow Black formatting (120 character line length)
- Pass all Ruff linting checks
- Include comprehensive type hints (checked by MyPy)
- Maintain minimum 95% docstring coverage
- Keep files under 500 lines and functions under 50 lines
- Maintain minimum 80% test coverage

### Architecture

- Follow clean architecture principles
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Design for extensibility

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Benchmark performance for critical paths

### Documentation

- Module-level docstrings explaining purpose and usage
- Function and class docstrings in Google style
- Complex algorithm explanations
- Usage examples in docstrings

## Quality Expectations

Phase 1 implementation should meet these quality expectations:

1. **Functionality**: All required features working correctly
2. **Performance**: Fast indexing and searching operations
3. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and edge case management
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite
5. **Code Quality**: Adherence to established standards
6. **Documentation**: Clear and complete documentation

## Completion Criteria

Phase 1 will be considered complete when:

1. All specified components are implemented
2. All required features are functional
3. The test suite passes with minimum coverage
4. Code quality tools report no issues
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
6. The MVP can be demonstrated in a terminal environment

The end result should be a usable file search application capable of indexing and searching files, with a basic terminal interface.
