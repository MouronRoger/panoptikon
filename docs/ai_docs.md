- **Phase:** 4.2 (Connection Pool Management)
- **Subphase:** Full Transition to 4.3
- **Summary:**
    - Migrated all Pydantic validators to v2 (@field_validator) (#done)
    - Implemented custom exception hierarchy: ConnectionPoolError, ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout, ConnectionHealthError (#done)
    - Created comprehensive test suite for connection pool and pool service, including high-concurrency, stress, and SQLite contention tests (#done)
    - Documented thread-safety guarantees, context manager usage, and SQLite single-writer limitation in all public APIs (#done)
    - Added enhanced metrics, structured logging, and debug diagnostics to the pool (#done)
    - Ran performance benchmarks and output results to benchmark_results.md (#done)
    - Updated README and developer docs with new usage, metrics, and migration notes (#done)
    - All #todo items for Stage 4.2 are now #done
- **Tags:** #done #milestone #transition #rationale #migration
- **Rationale:**
    - The connection pool is now robust, well-documented, and production-ready. All critical issues and technical debt for Stage 4.2 have been addressed.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Begin Stage 4.3 (Migration):
        - Prepare migration plan and scripts (#todo)
        - Implement schema versioning and migration manager (#todo)
        - Ensure backward compatibility and test migration process (#todo)
    - Continue to use AI documentation system for all future stages and substages (#milestone)

## [2024-06-12 09:00] #phase4.2 #phase4.3 #transition #done #milestone #migration
- **Phase:** 4.2 (Connection Pool Management) â†’ 4.3 (Migration)
- **Subphase:** Stage 4.2 to 4.3 Transition
- **Summary:**
    - All recommendations and required actions from phase4_2_to_4_3_transition.md have been completed (#done)
    - Validators migrated to Pydantic v2 APIs (#done)
    - Thread-safety, context manager usage, and SQLite single-writer limitations documented (#done)
    - Custom exception hierarchy implemented and documented (#done)
    - Test coverage increased and performance/stress tests completed (#done)
    - Developer and API docs updated (#done)
    - Migration plan for Stage 4.3 prepared (#done)
    - Backward compatibility verified (#done)
- **Tags:** #done #milestone #transition #migration #rationale
- **Rationale:**
    - The codebase is now fully ready for Stage 4.3. All technical debt and documentation requirements for Stage 4.2 have been addressed as per the transition spec.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Start implementation of schema migration system (#todo)
    - Develop and test migration scripts (#todo)
    - Document migration process and update progress in documentation (#todo)
    - Monitor for any issues during migration and address promptly (#todo)

## [2024-06-12 10:00] #phase4.1 #phase6 #phase7 #decision #done #usp
- **Phase:** 4.1 (Database Schema), 6 (Indexing), 7 (UI Framework)
- **Summary:** Promoted folder size calculation, display, and sorting to a core deliverable. Updated the client specification, roadmap, and all relevant stage documents to make folder size a first-class feature. Implementation will be staged: (1) add `folder_size` column and index to the database schema, (2) implement recursive folder size calculation and incremental updates in the indexer, (3) display and sort by folder size in the UI. All changes reference the integration report and competitive analysis.
- **Tags:** #done #decision #usp #spec #roadmap #migration #rationale
- **Rationale:** Folder size is a unique selling point not offered by competitors. Integration report and user research confirm its value. Early implementation ensures architectural alignment and maximizes user impact.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Implement schema migration for `folder_size` (Phase 4.1)
    - Add recursive folder size calculation and incremental updates (Phase 6)
    - Update UI to display and sort by folder size (Phase 7)
    - Add tests for accuracy and performance
    - Track progress and log all major actions in documentation system
