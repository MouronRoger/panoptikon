## [2025-05-12 10:00] #phase4.1 #phase6 #phase7 #decision #done #usp
- **Phase:** 4.1 (Database Schema), 6 (Indexing), 7 (UI Framework)
- **Summary:** Promoted folder size calculation, display, and sorting to a core deliverable. Updated the client specification, roadmap, and all relevant stage documents to make folder size a first-class feature. Implementation will be staged: (1) add `folder_size` column and index to the database schema, (2) implement recursive folder size calculation and incremental updates in the indexer, (3) display and sort by folder size in the UI. All changes reference the integration report and competitive analysis.
- **Tags:** #done #decision #usp #spec #roadmap #migration #rationale
- **Rationale:** Folder size is a unique selling point not offered by competitors. Integration report and user research confirm its value. Early implementation ensures architectural alignment and maximizes user impact.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Implement schema migration for `folder_size` (Phase 4.1)

- **Subphase:** Migration System Core, Safety, Recovery, and 1.1.0 Folder Size Migration
- **Summary:**
    - Implemented automated schema versioning and migration registry (#done)
    - Developed migration executor with backup, rollback, and verification (#done)
    - Added pre-migration backup, transaction-wrapped migrations, and post-migration verification (#done)
    - Implemented automatic rollback and recovery on migration failure (#done)
    - Migration lock prevents concurrent runs (#done)
    - Migration for schema version 1.1.0 (folder_size column and index) implemented and tested (#done)
    - All migration logic is idempotent and safe for repeated runs (#done)
    - Comprehensive tests for sequential migration, rollback, recovery, idempotency, and corrupted states (#done)
    - All code and tests meet project standards (Black, isort, Ruff, mypy --strict) (#done)
    - Documentation updated to reflect migration system and folder_size feature (#done)
- **Tags:** #done #milestone #migration #rationale #recovery #rollback #safety #idempotent
- **Rationale:**
    - Robust migration system is critical for safe schema evolution and user data integrity. Automated recovery and rollback ensure zero data loss. Idempotency and locking prevent accidental corruption. The folder_size migration is a dependency for future indexing and UI features.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Monitor for migration issues in real-world usage (#todo)
    - Begin Stage 6: Implement folder size calculation and incremental updates (#todo)
    - Prepare UI changes for folder size display and sorting (Stage 7) (#todo)

## [2025-05-12 15:30] #phase7 #ui #decision #done #testing #pyobjc #rationale
- **Phase:** 7 (UI Framework)
- **Summary:**
    - Implemented robust conditional import/skip logic in `tests/ui/test_ui_integration.py` to ensure pytest never collects or runs UI integration tests if PyObjC is not available.
    - The solution checks for PyObjC at the very top of the file, sets `__test__ = False`, defines a dummy function, and exits immediately if PyObjC is missing.
    - All pytest-specific imports and test code are placed below the check, so pytest never sees them if PyObjC is unavailable.
    - Added a detailed module-level docstring explaining the rationale, maintenance requirements, and usage for future developers.
    - This approach is robust, cross-platform, and future-proof, and avoids all issues with pytest collection, mocking, and skip logic.
- **Tags:** #done #decision #testing #pyobjc #rationale
- **Rationale:**
    - Previous skip/ignore mechanisms failed due to pytest's collection and parsing order and extensive mocking.
    - This pattern guarantees the file is invisible to pytest if PyObjC is not present, preventing confusing failures and maintenance headaches.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Document this pattern in developer onboarding and testing guides.
    - Apply similar patterns to other conditional test modules if needed. 

## [2025-05-11 14:00] #phase4.3 #schema-migration #assessment #done #milestone

- **Summary:**
    - Completed Pyright migration for all core and UI modules. All production code is now strictly type-checked and compliant with project standards.
    - Adopted a pragmatic approach for test typing: Pyright is set to strict for production code and basic for tests, minimizing noise and maximizing development velocity.
    - Expanded and cleaned up PyObjC stubs, wrappers, and UI patterns for robust type safety at the Python/Objective-C boundary.
    - Updated `pyrightconfig.json` to use `executionEnvironments` for strictness in `src/` and relaxed checking in `tests/`.
    - All major UI files (`macos_app.py`, `objc_wrappers.py`, `window_interfaces.py`, `events.py`, `validators.py`) are now type-annotated, formatted, and compliant.
- **Tags:** #done #migration #pyright #ui #rationale #milestone
