# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 4 - ConnectionManager

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 4: ConnectionManager, which handles database connections for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the ConnectionManager
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The ConnectionManager component:
- Manages SQLite database connections using SQLAlchemy
- Implements connection pooling for efficiency
- Provides a context manager for session management
- Handles database initialization and connection errors
- Ensures proper resource cleanup

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 5: Database Operations, which will handle CRUD operations for file metadata in the database.

## Observations

1. The ConnectionManager needs to work closely with the database schema module (Component 3)
2. Connection pooling must be configured appropriately for SQLite to avoid "database is locked" errors
3. The context manager pattern will ensure proper resource management
4. Thread safety is important for handling concurrent database access

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component4-connection-manager.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/db/connection.py`
