# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 13 - TerminalInterface

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 13: TerminalInterface, which provides a command-line interface for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the TerminalInterface class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The TerminalInterface component:
- Implements a basic terminal UI for the application
- Provides a command system for user interaction
- Supports as-you-type search with incremental updates
- Displays search results in a tabular format
- Shows progress during indexing operations
- Offers commands for indexing, searching, and viewing status
- Includes result pagination for large result sets

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 14: CommandLineArguments, which will parse command-line arguments for the application.

## Observations

1. The TerminalInterface provides a way to test the application without a GUI
2. The component uses a command pattern for extensibility
3. Progress display is important for long-running operations like indexing
4. Tabular output formatting improves readability of search results
5. The interface integrates multiple components: connection manager, indexing manager, and search engine
6. Clean error handling is essential for a good user experience

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component13-terminal-interface.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/cli/interface.py`
