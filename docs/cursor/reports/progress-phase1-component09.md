# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 9 - SearchEngine

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 9: SearchEngine, which provides the core search functionality for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the SearchEngine class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The SearchEngine component:
- Executes search queries against the file index database
- Implements relevance ranking for search results
- Provides synchronous, asynchronous, and incremental search capabilities
- Supports pagination for large result sets
- Handles search options like case sensitivity and sorting
- Collects performance metrics for optimization

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 10: QueryParser, which will parse search queries into structured representations for the search engine.

## Observations

1. Performance optimization is critical to meet the 200ms response time requirement
2. Relevance ranking is important for providing useful search results
3. Asynchronous and incremental search capabilities improve the user experience
4. Integration with other search components (QueryParser, FilterBuilder) is essential
5. The component relies on the database connection manager for data access

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component9-search-engine.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/search/engine.py`
