# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 8 - DirectoryMonitor

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 8: DirectoryMonitor, which monitors file system changes for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the DirectoryMonitor class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The DirectoryMonitor component:
- Watches directories for file system changes (creation, modification, deletion, moves)
- Uses platform-specific APIs for efficiency (FSEvents, inotify, etc.)
- Implements event debouncing to handle rapid changes
- Provides a queue-based event system
- Supports recursive directory monitoring
- Manages event processing with proper threading

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 9: SearchEngine, which will provide the core search functionality for finding files by name, path, and other attributes.

## Observations

1. Platform-specific APIs are crucial for efficient directory monitoring
2. Debouncing is important for handling rapid file system changes
3. Thread safety is essential for reliable monitoring
4. Resource management must be carefully implemented to avoid leaks
5. The component will integrate with the IndexingManager to keep the index updated

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component8-directory-monitor.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/index/monitor.py`
