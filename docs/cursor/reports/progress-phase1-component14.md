# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 14 - CommandLineArguments

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 14: CommandLineArguments, which handles command-line argument parsing for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the CommandLineArguments module
3. The complete interface with function signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The CommandLineArguments component:
- Parses command-line arguments using argparse
- Supports subcommands for different operations (index, search, status, etc.)
- Provides global options like verbosity and database path
- Includes validation for argument values
- Configures logging based on verbosity level
- Returns a clean structure with parsed arguments
- Offers comprehensive help text

## Next Component

This is the final component of Phase 1 for the Panoptikon application. After this, the implementation should proceed to Phase 2 or focus on integration testing and refinement of the Phase 1 components.

## Observations

1. The CommandLineArguments module provides a user-friendly command-line interface
2. The subcommand structure organizes functionality in a clean way
3. Global options ensure consistent behavior across commands
4. Validation helps prevent runtime errors from invalid input
5. Help text and examples improve usability
6. The module integrates with the TerminalInterface (Component 13) for interactive use

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component14-command-line-arguments.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/cli/args.py`
