# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 5 - DatabaseOperations

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 5: DatabaseOperations, which handles CRUD operations for file metadata in the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the DatabaseOperations class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The DatabaseOperations component:
- Performs CRUD operations for file and directory metadata
- Supports batch operations for better performance
- Implements search functionality for files
- Uses parameterized queries for security
- Manages transactions for data consistency
- Provides database statistics

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 6: Migration Manager, which will handle database schema migrations for the application.

## Observations

1. The DatabaseOperations component depends on both the database schema (Component 3) and the connection manager (Component 4)
2. Batch operations are critical for efficient indexing of large file systems
3. The search functionality needs to be optimized for performance (<200ms response time)
4. Proper transaction management is important for data consistency
5. The component should support parameterized queries for security

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component5-database-operations.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/db/operations.py`
