# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 11 - FilterBuilder

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 11: FilterBuilder, which converts parsed search queries into database filters for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the FilterBuilder class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The FilterBuilder component:
- Converts parsed query nodes into SQL filter conditions
- Implements filters for terms, phrases, and wildcard patterns
- Supports composition of filters with AND, OR, and NOT operators
- Handles case sensitivity options
- Converts wildcard patterns to SQL LIKE patterns
- Generates optimized SQL queries for the database

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 12: ResultsManager, which will handle search result organization, sorting, and presentation.

## Observations

1. The FilterBuilder bridges the gap between parsed queries and database operations
2. The component uses a clean object-oriented approach with filter composition
3. Security is important with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. Performance optimization is critical for meeting the 200ms response time requirement
5. The design allows for extension with advanced filters in future phases
6. The component integrates with both the QueryParser (Component 10) and the SearchEngine (Component 9)

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component11-filter-builder.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/search/filters.py`
