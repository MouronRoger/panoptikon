# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 10 - QueryParser

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 10: QueryParser, which parses search queries for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the QueryParser class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The QueryParser component:
- Parses search queries into structured representations
- Supports basic pattern matching and wildcards
- Handles quoted phrases for exact matching
- Provides case sensitivity options
- Lays the groundwork for extended syntax in future phases
- Handles escaping of special characters
- Provides clear error messages for invalid queries

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 11: FilterBuilder, which will convert parsed queries into database filters.

## Observations

1. The QueryParser provides the foundation for the search syntax
2. The component uses a tokenizer and parse tree approach for flexibility
3. Support for wildcards and quoted phrases improves search capabilities
4. The design allows for extension with Boolean operators and filters in future phases
5. Clear error reporting is important for user experience
6. The component will integrate with the SearchEngine (Component 9)

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component10-query-parser.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/search/parser.py`
