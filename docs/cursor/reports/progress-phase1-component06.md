# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 6 - MigrationManager

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 6: MigrationManager, which handles database schema migrations for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the MigrationManager class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The MigrationManager component:
- Tracks database schema versions
- Applies migrations in the correct order
- Verifies schema integrity after migrations
- Supports migration rollback
- Provides automated migration to the latest version
- Integrates with the database schema and connection manager

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 7: IndexingManager, which will coordinate file crawling, metadata extraction, and database storage.

## Observations

1. The MigrationManager depends on the database schema (Component 3) and indirectly on the connection manager (Component 4)
2. Transaction safety is crucial during migrations to prevent database corruption
3. Schema verification is important to ensure application compatibility
4. Proper versioning helps maintain database consistency as the application evolves
5. Rollback capability is essential for recovering from problematic migrations

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component6-migration-manager.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/db/migrations.py`
