# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 7 - IndexingManager

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 7: IndexingManager, which coordinates file indexing operations for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the IndexingManager class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The IndexingManager component:
- Coordinates file crawling, metadata extraction, and database storage
- Implements a multi-threaded approach for performance (1000+ files/second)
- Provides throttling to control system resource usage
- Tracks and reports indexing progress
- Handles interruptions and cleanup
- Supports batch operations for efficiency

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 8: DirectoryMonitor, which will monitor file system changes to keep the index up to date.

## Observations

1. The IndexingManager integrates multiple components: FileCrawler (Component 1), MetadataExtractor (Component 2), and database operations (Component 5)
2. The threading model is critical for achieving the performance target of 1000+ files/second
3. Batch processing is important for both memory efficiency and database performance
4. Progress reporting is essential for the user interface
5. Proper resource cleanup is necessary when indexing is interrupted

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component7-indexing-manager.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/index/indexer.py`
