# Progress Report: Phase 1 Component 12 - ResultsManager

## Completed Tasks

I've created the prompt for Component 12: ResultsManager, which handles search results for the Panoptikon application. The prompt includes:

1. A clear description of the component's responsibilities
2. Specific requirements for the ResultsManager class
3. The complete interface with method signatures and docstrings
4. Implementation details and considerations
5. Testing requirements
6. Quality standards from the style guide
7. File location information
8. Example usage code

## Component Details

The ResultsManager component:
- Implements virtual loading for efficient handling of large result sets
- Supports sorting results by any metadata field
- Provides client-side filtering capabilities
- Implements paging for large result sets
- Offers both synchronous and asynchronous access patterns
- Includes serialization for display in the UI
- Efficiently manages memory with batch processing

## Next Component

The next component to implement is Component 13: TerminalInterface, which will provide a command-line interface for the application.

## Observations

1. The ResultsManager focuses on efficient memory management for large result sets
2. The component provides flexible sorting and filtering capabilities
3. Asynchronous iteration support improves performance for large result sets
4. The clean serialization interface makes it easy to display results in the UI
5. The component completes the search system along with the SearchEngine, QueryParser, and FilterBuilder
6. Paging functionality is essential for handling large search results

## File Location

The prompt has been saved to:
`/Users/james/Documents/GitHub/panoptikon/docs/prompts/phase-1-prompts/component12-results-manager.md`

The implementation should be created at:
`src/panoptikon/search/results.py`
