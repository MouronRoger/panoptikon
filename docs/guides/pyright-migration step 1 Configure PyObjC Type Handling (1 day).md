### tep 1: Configure PyObjC Type Handling (1 day)
Create a dedicated type stubs directory for PyObjC interfaces:

### bash
mkdir -p src/panoptikon/typings/objc
Update your pyrightconfig.json with more specific PyObjC handling:

### json
{
  "typeCheckingMode": "basic", *// Temporarily reduce strictness for transition*
  "reportMissingImports": false, *// Suppress import errors for transition*
  "ignore": ["**/tests/ui/**/*.py"], *// Temporarily ignore UI tests*
  "extraPaths": ["src/panoptikon/typings"]
}
### Step 2: Implement Progressive Resolution (2-3 days)
**1** **Create minimal PyObjC stubs first**:
	* Focus on the most commonly used classes/methods
	* Start with AppKit.NSWindow, NSButton, NSTableView
	* Use Any liberally at first to get things passing
**2** **Introduce strategic type ignores**: For dynamic code patterns that are difficult to type: ### python
*# For truly dynamic or runtime-dependent code*
3 result = some_dynamic_code()  *# type: ignore[attr-defined]*
4 
*5* *# For test mocks with complex signatures*
6 mock_function.assert_called_with(ANY)  *# type: ignore[arg-type]*


**7** **Create pattern library**: Document common PyObjC typing patterns in a reference file for the team

⠀Step 3: Address Tests Systematically (2 days)
**1** **Fix test utilities first**:
	* Address typing in helper functions/fixtures
	* Proper typing for mocks and test data
**2** **Add custom pytest plugin** to handle type information for test fixtures: ### python
*# In conftest.py or a custom plugin*
3 from typing import Any, Callable, TypeVar
4 
5 T = TypeVar('T')
6 
7 def typed_fixture(func: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
8     """Wrapper for fixtures that preserves type information."""
9     return pytest.fixture(func)  *# type: ignore*


**10** **Use consistent patterns** for mock type annotations: ### python
from unittest.mock import Mock, MagicMock
11 
*12* *# Typed mocks*
13 mock_service: Mock[ServiceInterface] = Mock(spec=ServiceInterface)



⠀Step 4: Automate and Enforce (1 day)
**1** **Create VS Code task** for targeting specific directories: ### json
{
2   "label": "Pyright - UI Code Only",
3   "type": "shell",
4   "command": "pyright src/panoptikon/ui"
5 }


**6** **Implement staged CI pipeline** that:
	* Enforces strict checking on core modules
	* Gradually increases strictness on test/UI code
	* Uses include/exclude patterns to track progress

⠀Practical Advice
Focus on the highest-value targets first:
**1** **Address the most frequent error patterns** that affect multiple files
**2** **Create minimal type stubs** for PyObjC instead of solving everything at once
**3** **Maintain momentum** by keeping the codebase in a working state

⠀This approach balances progress with practicality, following the Land Rover philosophy of focusing on robustness and simplicity. You'll see continuous improvement while maintaining development velocity.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this approach, or help with implementing any particular step?
