# Multi-Window Implementation Specification

## üéØ Core Requirements

### Purpose
Enable users to work with multiple Panoptikon windows for enhanced file management workflows, particularly drag-and-drop operations between different search contexts.

### Unique Selling Point (USP)
**Cross-window drag-and-drop** - Unlike Everything (which doesn't support this), Panoptikon enables dragging files between search windows, creating powerful workflows for file organization across different search contexts.

### Key Specifications
- **Window Creation**: Primary via interface button, keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N) also supported
- **Initial Positioning**: New windows appear alongside existing window as dual-pane layout
- **Independence**: Windows can be moved freely across screens after creation
- **Resource Management**: Only one window is active at a time
- **Singleton Architecture**: Single instances of core services shared across windows
- **Primary Use Case**: Drag files from one window to folders displayed in another
- **No Position Persistence**: Fresh window arrangement on each app launch
- **No Creation Effects**: Simple appearance without animation or sound

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Window State Management

```
WindowState {
  - windowId: UUID
  - isActive: Boolean
  - searchQuery: String  // Always visible in search field
  - activeTab: TabIdentifier
  - selectedFiles: Array<FileReference>
  - scrollPosition: CGPoint
  - columnConfiguration: ColumnSettings
  - filterState: FilterConfiguration
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Maintain WindowState objects for all windows
- Persist search query in UI to maintain context
- Use NSWindowController pattern for window lifecycle
- Default positioning for new windows beside existing

### 2. Active Window Coordination

```
WindowManager (Singleton) {
  - activeWindow: WindowIdentifier
  - windows: Dictionary<WindowIdentifier, WindowState>
  - activateWindow(id: WindowIdentifier)
  - suspendWindow(id: WindowIdentifier)
  - coordinateDragOperation(source: WindowIdentifier, target: WindowIdentifier)
}
```

**Activation Triggers**:
- User clicks in window
- Drag operation initiated from window
- Window brought to foreground

### 3. Resource Management Strategy

**When Window Becomes Active**:
- Resume file system monitoring
- Refresh search results if needed
- Restore scroll position and selection

**When Window Becomes Inactive**:
- Pause file system event processing
- Cache current result set
- Suspend background operations
- Maintain UI responsiveness for drop targets

### 4. Drag-and-Drop Coordination

**Cross-Window Operations**:
1. Drag initiated from inactive window ‚Üí activate source window
2. Track source window ID in drag session
3. Drop in target window ‚Üí process through active window's services
4. Log transaction with source and target window context

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Mitigation

### 1. State Synchronization
**Issue**: File system changes while window inactive  
**Mitigation**: 
- Mark inactive windows as "stale"
- Quick refresh on reactivation
- Visual indicator for outdated results

### 2. Resource Contention
**Issue**: Multiple windows competing for file handles/locks  
**Mitigation**:
- Centralized file operation queue
- Read operations can be concurrent
- Write operations serialize through active window

### 3. User Confusion
**Issue**: Which window is active may be unclear  
**Mitigation**:
- Active window displays with full color styling
- Inactive windows shift to monochrome/grayscale appearance
- Instant visual feedback on window activation
- No additional UI elements needed - the color state is the indicator

### 4. Memory Usage
**Issue**: Large result sets cached in inactive windows  
**Mitigation**:
- Implement result set size limits
- Lazy loading for cached results
- Periodic memory pressure cleanup

### 5. Window Proliferation
**Issue**: Users creating too many windows  
**Mitigation**:
- Soft limit (e.g., 5 windows) with warning
- Window management menu showing all windows
- "Close inactive windows" option

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Window Chrome**: Standard macOS window controls (close/minimize/maximize)
- **Distinct from Finder**: Custom appearance to create visual distance
- **Search Field**: Always displays current query for context
- **No Effects**: Simple window appearance without animations
- **Active/Inactive States**: 
  - Active window: Full color interface
  - Inactive windows: Monochrome/grayscale appearance
  - Immediate visual transition on focus change

### Window Positioning
- **Initial Layout**: New window appears beside existing (dual-pane style)
- **Smart Positioning**: 
  - If screen space permits: side-by-side
  - If not: cascade with offset
  - Multi-monitor aware
- **User Control**: Full freedom to reposition after creation

### Keyboard Support
- **Window Creation**: Cmd+N (standard macOS convention)
- **Window Switching**: Cmd+` (standard macOS window cycling)
- **Search Focus**: Cmd+F or auto-focus on type

## üìä Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Multi-Window
- Window creation via button and Cmd+N
- Dual-pane positioning logic
- Independent search states
- Basic active/inactive management

### Stage 2: Drag-Drop Support
- Cross-window drag coordination
- Transaction tracking
- Drop target highlighting
- Multi-monitor awareness

### Stage 3: Resource Optimization
- Smart state caching
- Background operation suspension
- Memory management
- Performance monitoring

### Stage 4: Polish
- Visual state indicators
- Refined positioning algorithm
- Window management UI
- Performance optimizations

## üèÜ Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: Window switching < 100ms
2. **Memory**: Inactive windows use < 10MB cached state
3. **Reliability**: Zero data loss during cross-window operations
4. **Usability**: Clear active window indication
5. **Scalability**: Handles 5+ windows gracefully
6. **USP Delivery**: Seamless drag-drop between windows (not available in Everything)

## üîÑ Alternative Approaches Considered

### Rejected: True Multi-Instance
- **Why**: Complex singleton synchronization
- **Why**: Duplicate resource usage
- **Why**: Potential race conditions

### Rejected: Single Window with Tabs
- **Why**: Doesn't support drag between contexts
- **Why**: Less flexible workflow

### Rejected: Process-per-Window
- **Why**: IPC overhead
- **Why**: Complex state sharing
- **Why**: Higher memory footprint

## üìù Open Questions

1. **Window Positioning Algorithm**: Exact offset for cascade when side-by-side isn't possible?
2. **Maximum Windows**: Hard limit or just performance warning?
3. **Visual Distinction**: Specific design elements to differentiate from Finder?
4. **Active Window Indicator**: Title bar highlight, border, or other method?
5. **Multi-Monitor Behavior**: Which screen gets new windows by default?
