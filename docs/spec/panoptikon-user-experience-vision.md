# Panoptikon: The Ultimate File Search Experience

## The Problem: Finding Your Files Shouldn't Be So Hard

In today's digital world, we create and interact with thousands of files across our devices and cloud storage services. Yet, the fundamental task of finding these files remains surprisingly difficult on macOS:

**Spotlight falls short** when you need to search by filename alone, wasting valuable time with irrelevant content matches. It's slow, lacks advanced filtering, and doesn't provide the quick, responsive experience you need.

**Finder search** is cumbersome, limited to specific folders, and lacks the speed and flexibility needed for serious file management.

**Cloud storage** adds another layer of complexity‚Äîwith files scattered across iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, finding what you need becomes a hunt across multiple services.

The result? Frustration, wasted time, and the nagging feeling that your computer should be doing this simple task better.
