# 🚧 STAGE 3: FILESYSTEM ABSTRACTION

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Create resilient file system monitoring abstraction
- Implement permission-aware file operations
- Build cloud storage detection foundation
- Develop security-scoped bookmark handling
- Establish path normalization and handling system

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **FSEvents Wrapper**:
   - Implement isolated FSEvents integration
   - Create polling-based fallback mechanism
   - Add event coalescing and filtering
   - Design shadow verification for network storage

2. **FS Access Abstraction**:
   - Implement permission-aware file system operations
   - Create file operation delegator with provider detection
   - Support progressive permission acquisition
   - Build permission state visualization system

3. **Cloud Detection**:
   - Implement cloud storage provider identification
   - Create provider-agnostic detection mechanisms
   - Support major providers (iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box)
   - Design offline handling strategy

4. **Security Bookmarks**:
   - Implement security-scoped bookmark creation
   - Create persistence and restoration mechanism
   - Build bookmark management system
   - Support sandbox-compatible file access

5. **Path Management**:
   - Implement path normalization and canonicalization
   - Create path comparison utilities
   - Build include/exclude rule evaluation system
   - Develop efficient path storage and lookup

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Test FSEvents with various event scenarios
- Verify fallback mechanism works when FSEvents fails
- Validate cloud detection across providers
- Confirm security bookmarks persist across restarts
- Ensure path rules correctly filter files
- Test operation with different permission levels
- Maintain 95% code coverage

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS
- Use dependency injection for all components
- Design for testability with mock implementations
- Focus on resilience against OS changes
- Maintain clear abstraction boundaries

## 📋 DEPENDENCIES
- Stage 2 service container
- Stage 2 event bus
- Stage 2 configuration system
- Stage 2 error handling
