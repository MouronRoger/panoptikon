# 🚧 STAGE 10: OPTIMIZATION

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Fine-tune performance to meet all target metrics
- Optimize memory usage and management
- Verify resilience mechanisms work reliably
- Refine user experience details
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Optimize dual-window operations and resource usage

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Fine-tune application startup to <100ms
   - Optimize search latency to consistently <50ms
   - Ensure UI renders at 60fps at all times
   - Improve indexing speed to handle 250k files in <60s
   - Minimize memory and CPU footprint
   - Optimize window switching performance to <100ms

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Profile and fix memory leaks
   - Optimize caching strategies
   - Improve PyObjC boundary crossing patterns
   - Ensure proper object ownership and thread confinement
   - Implement dynamic resource adjustment
   - Reduce inactive window memory usage to <10MB

3. **Resilience Verification**:
   - Test file monitoring across various scenarios
   - Validate behavior with different permission levels
   - Verify cloud integration across providers
   - Test component abstraction effectiveness
   - Enhance recovery mechanisms
   - Verify cross-window operations reliability

4. **User Experience Refinement**:
   - Create welcoming first-run experience
   - Implement contextual help system
   - Finalize keyboard shortcuts
   - Polish UI details and animations
   - Add subtle user guidance
   - Refine active/inactive window visual states
   - Enhance cross-window drag-and-drop feedback

5. **Monitoring and Diagnostics**:
   - Implement performance tracking
   - Create diagnostic logging
   - Build crash reporting mechanism
   - Design usage analytics (opt-in)
   - Develop troubleshooting tools
   - Add window state monitoring and metrics

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
