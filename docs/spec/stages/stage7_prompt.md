# 🚧 STAGE 7: UI FRAMEWORK

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Implement native macOS UI with AppKit via PyObjC
- Create dual-paradigm interface (keyboard and mouse)
- Build search field, tab bar, and results table
- Implement context menus and file operations
- Develop progress visualization and status displays

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Window and Controls**:
   - Implement main application window
   - Create search input with real-time filtering
   - Build tab bar for category filtering
   - Implement virtual table view for results
   - Create column management system

2. **Interaction Model**:
   - Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation
   - Create context menus for operations
   - Build drag and drop support
   - Implement selection management
   - Design default file actions

3. **UI Component Abstraction**:
   - Implement composition pattern for UI
   - Create separation between UI and business logic
   - Build accessibility support for VoiceOver
   - Design layout adaptation for screen densities

4. **Progress and Feedback**:
   - Create non-intrusive progress visualization
   - Implement status bar for information
   - Add contextual tooltips
   - Build user-friendly error notifications
   - Create smooth animations and transitions

5. **UI-Core Integration**:
   - Implement search integration
   - Create result display binding
   - Build operation delegation
   - Design state synchronization

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Verify UI renders at 60fps during operations
- Test keyboard navigation covers all functions
- Validate context menus work correctly
- Measure UI responsiveness during indexing
- Verify VoiceOver accessibility
- Test UI with large result sets
- Maintain interface compliance with HIG
- Test UI component isolation

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS
- Use composition over inheritance for UI
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Design for resilience against UI framework changes
- Support both keyboard and mouse workflows equally

## 📋 DEPENDENCIES
- Stage 2 service container
- Stage 5 search engine
- Stage 6 indexing system

## Folder Size Display in UI

- Add a "Folder Size" column to the results table, visible for directories.
- Format folder sizes in human-readable units (KB/MB/GB).
- Enable sorting by folder size in the UI.
- This provides instant visibility into space usage and is a unique selling point (see Integration Report).
- Depends on schema and indexing work in earlier stages.
