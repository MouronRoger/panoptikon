# 🔍 SEGMENT 5.5: FILTERING SYSTEM

## 📋 CONTEXT
**Stage**: 5 - Search Engine
**Segment**: 5.5 - Filtering System
**Dependencies**: Sorting System (Segment 5.4), Result Management (Segment 5.3), Database Foundation (Stage 4)

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES
Develop a comprehensive filtering framework that enables users to refine search results based on file attributes, with support for cascading filters, custom filter chains, and high-performance application even with large result sets.

## 📑 SPECIFICATIONS

### Core Requirements
- Build modular filter application framework
- Implement file type and extension filters
- Create date range filtering (created/modified)
- Support size range filtering
- Enable path-based filtering
- Allow custom filter chain creation
- Support tab-based predefined filters

### Technical Implementation
1. Develop FilterEngine class with modular design
2. Create FilterCriteria abstraction for different filter types
3. Implement database-level filtering for performance
4. Build client-side filtering for complex cases
5. Design filter combination logic (AND, OR, NOT)

### Performance Targets
- Filter application under 50ms for 10,000+ results
- Optimize filter application at database layer when possible
- Minimal memory overhead for filtered results

## 🧪 TEST REQUIREMENTS

### Unit Tests
- Test file type filtering
- Test extension filtering
- Test date range filtering
- Test size range filtering
- Test path filtering
- Test custom filter functions
- Test filter combinations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Test filter performance with large result sets

### Integration Tests
- Test integration with result management
- Test integration with sorting system
- Verify database-level filter optimization
- Test filtering with various result set sizes
- Verify memory usage during filter operations

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Key Design Principles
- Apply Composite pattern for filter combinations
- Push filtering to database layer when possible
- Use lazy evaluation for complex filter chains
- Maintain clear separation between filter definition and application

### Interfaces
```python
# Key interfaces (not actual implementation)
class FilterCriteria:
    """Abstract base class for filter criteria"""
    
    def apply_to_query(self, query):
        """
        Apply filter to database query
        
        Args:
            query: Database query to modify
            
        Returns:
            Modified query with filter applied
        """
        pass
    
    def matches(self, result):
        """
        Check if result matches filter (client-side)
        
        Args:
            result: SearchResult to check
            
        Returns:
            Boolean indicating if result matches
        """
        pass

class FilterEngine:
    """Engine for applying filters to result sets"""
    
    def apply_filter(self, result_set, criteria):
        """
        Apply filter criteria to result set
        
        Args:
            result_set: ResultSet to filter
            criteria: FilterCriteria or composite filter
            
        Returns:
            Filtered ResultSet
        """
        pass
    
    def create_filter(self, filter_type, **params):
        """
        Create filter of specified type
        
        Args:
            filter_type: Type of filter to create
            params: Filter-specific parameters
            
        Returns:
            FilterCriteria instance
        """
        pass
    
    def combine_filters(self, filters, operator="AND"):
        """
        Combine multiple filters
        
        Args:
            filters: List of filters to combine
            operator: "AND", "OR", or "NOT"
            
        Returns:
            CompositeFilter instance
        """
        pass
```

### Tab-Based Filtering Implementation
- Implement predefined filter sets for standard tabs
- Support user-defined custom tab filters
- Enable efficient switching between tab filters
- Preserve applied filters when switching tabs

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful fallback to client-side filtering when database filter fails
- Clear error messages for invalid filter criteria
- Detection of conflicting or impossible filter combinations

## 🏁 COMPLETION CRITERIA
- All unit tests passing
- Filtering operations under 50ms for 10k results
- Memory-efficient filtering verified
- Integration tests confirm correct behavior with result sets
- Tab-based filtering working correctly
- 95% code coverage
- Zero lint errors
- Documentation complete
