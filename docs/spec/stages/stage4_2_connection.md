# 🔌 STAGE 4.2: CONNECTION POOL MANAGEMENT

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Implement thread-safe connection pooling
- Create connection lifecycle management
- Add health monitoring and recovery
- Support transaction isolation levels

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### 1. Connection Pool Core 🏊
- **Pool Manager**: Thread-safe connection allocation
- **Connection Factory**: Consistent connection creation
- **Pool Configuration**: Configurable size and timeout settings
- **Resource Tracking**: Monitor active/idle connections

### 2. Thread Safety Implementation 🔒
```python
# Use threading.Lock for pool access
# Implement connection checkout/checkin
# Add timeout handling for connection acquisition
# Ensure proper cleanup on thread termination
```

### 3. Lifecycle Management ♻️
1. Connection creation with consistent settings
2. Health check implementation
3. Automatic reconnection on failure
4. Graceful shutdown handling
5. Connection aging and rotation

### 4. Transaction Support 📝
- **Isolation Levels**: DEFERRED, IMMEDIATE, EXCLUSIVE
- **Context Managers**: Automatic transaction handling
- **Rollback Safety**: Ensure rollback on exceptions
- **Nested Transactions**: Savepoint support

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Test concurrent access with multiple threads
- Verify connection limit enforcement
- Test timeout behavior under load
- Validate health check functionality
- Test automatic reconnection after database lock
- Ensure proper resource cleanup
- Test transaction isolation levels
- Maintain 95% code coverage

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Pool handles 100 concurrent threads
- Zero connection leaks under stress testing
- Health checks detect unhealthy connections
- Transactions properly isolated
- Graceful degradation under resource pressure

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS
- Use only standard library threading
- No external connection pool libraries
- Must work with SQLite's single-writer limitation
- Support both in-memory and file databases

## 📋 DEPENDENCIES
- Stage 4.1: Database schema (for connections)
- Stage 2: Service container (for registration)
- Stage 2: Configuration (pool settings)
- Stage 2: Error handling (exceptions)

## 🏗️ CODE STANDARDS
- **Type Hints**: Generic types for connection types
- **Context Managers**: Use contextlib for resource management
- **Thread Safety**: Document all thread-safe guarantees
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Custom exceptions for pool errors
- **Testing**: Use threading in tests to verify safety
- **Performance**: Profile connection acquisition time
