# Stage 6.6: Progress Tracking and Feedback

## Overview

The Progress Tracking and Feedback module provides users with accurate, non-intrusive information about indexing operations. This component calculates progress metrics, estimates completion times, and delivers appropriate UI updates while minimizing performance impact on core indexing operations.

## Objectives

- Implement accurate progress calculation for indexing operations
- Create event publication system for UI feedback
- Build non-intrusive progress visualization
- Optimize UI updates to minimize performance impact

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Progress Calculation

- Implement file count estimation:
  ```python
  def estimate_total_files(paths):
      """Estimate total number of files to be indexed."""
      # Start with a statistical sample for large directories
      sample_count = 0
      sample_dirs = 0
      
      for path in paths:
          try:
              # Sample top-level directories
              if os.path.isdir(path):
                  entries = list(os.scandir(path))
                  sample_count += len([e for e in entries if e.is_file()])
                  
                  # Count subdirectories and sample some
                  subdirs = [e for e in entries if e.is_dir()]
                  sample_dirs += len(subdirs)
                  
                  # Sample some subdirectories (limited to avoid long startup)
                  for subdir in subdirs[:5]:
                      try:
                          subentries = list(os.scandir(subdir.path))
                          sample_count += len([e for e in subentries if e.is_file()])
                      except OSError:
                          continue
          except OSError:
              continue
              
      # Use statistical model based on samples
      # (simplified - actual implementation would be more sophisticated)
      if sample_dirs > 0:
          avg_files_per_dir = sample_count / (sample_dirs + len(paths))
          # Estimate based on directory depth and breadth analysis
          # This is a placeholder for a more complex algorithm
          return int(avg_files_per_dir * estimate_total_directories(paths))
      else:
          return sample_count
  ```

- Create progress percentage calculation:
  - Track files processed vs. estimated total
  - Implement adaptive estimation for accuracy
  - Create weighted progress for multi-stage operations

- Build time remaining estimation:
  - Calculate processing rate (files/second)
  - Implement moving average for stability
  - Create ETA prediction with confidence interval

### 2. Event Publication

- Implement progress notification events:
  ```python
  def publish_progress(processed, total, rate, eta):
      """Publish progress event to event bus."""
      event_data = {
          'processed': processed,
          'total': total,
          'percent': (processed / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0,
          'rate': rate,  # Files per second
          'eta': eta     # Estimated seconds remaining
      }
      
      event_bus.publish('IndexingProgressEvent', event_data)
  ```

- Create incremental update notifications:
  - Event for indexing start
  - Throttled progress updates (max 5 per second)
  - Completion notification

- Build error reporting events:
  - Error categorization
  - Error count and summary
  - Recovery status

### 3. UI Integration

- Create progress indicator data structures:
  - Progress model with binding support
  - Throttled update mechanism
  - Estimation quality indicators

- Implement throttled UI updates:
  - Limit update frequency (5 updates/second max)
  - Batch updates for efficiency
  - Prioritize UI responsiveness

- Build non-intrusive notification system:
  - Unobtrusive progress bar
  - Optional details panel
  - Background status indicators
  - Status bar integration

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test estimation algorithms with various inputs
   - Verify progress calculation accuracy
   - Test time remaining estimation with simulated data

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test event publication during indexing
   - Verify UI update frequency control
   - Test with various indexing scenarios

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure impact of progress tracking on indexing speed
   - Benchmark UI update efficiency
   - Verify minimal main thread impact

## Success Criteria

- File count estimation accurate within 20% margin
- Progress percentage calculation accurate within 5% margin
- Time remaining estimation reasonable for typical operations
- UI updates limited to 5 per second maximum
- Progress tracking overhead <5% of total indexing time
- 95% test coverage achieved
- Non-intrusive presentation in UI

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Core Indexing Framework (Stage 6.1), File System Monitoring (Stage 6.5)
- **Required by**: None (but enhances overall user experience)

## Time Estimate

- Implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1 day
