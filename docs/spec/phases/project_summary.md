# 🚧 PANOPTIKON PROJECT - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## 📋 Project Overview

Panoptikon is a high-performance macOS filename search utility designed to provide instant search across all storage locations with zero configuration. The application focuses on delivering sub-50ms search response times, complete visibility across local, network, and cloud storage, and a dual-paradigm interface supporting both keyboard and mouse workflows.

## 🔄 Implementation Approach

The project will be implemented in 11 distinct phases, each with clear objectives, tasks, testing requirements, and deliverables. Each phase builds upon the previous ones, gradually constructing the complete system while maintaining testability, quality, and focused OS resilience.

## 📑 Phase Structure

Each phase follows a consistent structure:

1. **Load Module Spec**: Review relevant specifications from project documentation
2. **Analyze Context**: Identify objectives, interfaces, constraints, and dependencies
3. **Construct Prompt**: Define specific implementation tasks and requirements
4. **Implement**: Execute the defined tasks following strict coding standards
5. **Test and Format**: Verify implementation meets requirements and follows standards
6. **Propagate State**: Document completion with report, prompt archive, and knowledge graph update

## 📊 Quality Control

Throughout all phases, the following quality standards will be maintained:

- **Zero lint errors**: All code must pass flake8 with plugins
- **Type safety**: All code must pass mypy in strict mode
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 95% code coverage required
- **Performance**: Regular benchmarking against target metrics
- **Architecture**: Strict adherence to defined patterns and interfaces
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for all public interfaces

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

The 11 phases are designed to be implemented sequentially:

1. **Project Setup** (Foundation) - Week 1-2
2. **Core Infrastructure** (Framework) - Week 3
3. **Filesystem Abstraction** (Critical OS Layer) - Week 3-4
4. **Database Foundation** (Data Layer) - Week 4-5
5. **Search Engine** (Core Functionality) - Week 5-6
6. **Indexing System** (Core Functionality) - Week 6-7
7. **UI Framework** (User Experience) - Week 7-8
8. **Cloud Integration** (Extended Functionality) - Week 9
9. **System Integration** (Extended Functionality) - Week 9-10
10. **Optimization** (Performance) - Week 10-12
11. **Packaging** (Release) - Week 13

## 🏆 Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. **Performance targets** are consistently met:
   - Search latency <50ms
   - Launch time <100ms
   - UI rendering at 60fps
   - Indexing 250k files in <60s

2. **Quality targets** are achieved:
   - Zero known critical bugs
   - Test coverage ≥95%
   - All accessibility requirements met
   - Bundle size <30MB

3. **User experience** goals are realized:
   - Complete first-run experience
   - Dual-paradigm support verified
   - Cloud integration working seamlessly
   - All core workflows tested and functional

## 🚀 Next Steps

Development will begin with Phase 1: Project Setup, establishing the foundation for all subsequent phases. Each phase will include comprehensive documentation and testing to ensure consistent progress and maintainable code.
