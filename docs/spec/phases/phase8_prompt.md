# üöß PHASE 8: CLOUD INTEGRATION

## üìù OBJECTIVES
- Implement comprehensive cloud provider integration
- Create cloud file status visualization
- Build provider-specific operation handling
- Develop placeholder support for cloud-only files
- Implement offline handling strategies

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Provider Detection**:
   - Implement cloud storage identification
   - Create provider-specific detection logic
   - Build path pattern recognition
   - Support major providers (iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box)

2. **Status Visualization**:
   - Create indicators for cloud files
   - Implement status change monitoring
   - Build download progress visualization
   - Design offline indicator system

3. **Operation Delegation to System/Finder**:
   - Build system delegation layer using NSWorkspace
   - Implement operation routing that always delegates cloud operations to Finder
   - Create fallback mechanisms (e.g., if NSWorkspace fails, use `open` command)
   - Support provider-native operations through system delegation, NOT direct APIs
   - NEVER implement direct cloud provider download/sync - let Finder handle everything

4. **Placeholder Support**:
   - Implement cloud-only file indicators
   - Create on-demand download triggering
   - Build placeholder metadata extraction
   - Support operation queueing during download

5. **Offline Handling**:
   - Create graceful offline experience
   - Implement cached operation queuing
   - Build synchronization on reconnection
   - Design offline mode indicators

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Verify cloud files correctly identified
- Test operations across providers
- Validate placeholder handling
- Measure performance with cloud-only files
- Verify offline mode functions correctly
- Test reconnection synchronization
- Validate graceful degradation

## üö´ CONSTRAINTS
- Design for provider-agnostic operation where possible
- Support offline functionality
- Maintain consistent user experience across providers
- Handle provider failures gracefully

## üìã DEPENDENCIES
- Phase 2 service container
- Phase 3 filesystem operations
- Phase 3 cloud detection
- Phase 7 UI framework
