# 🚧 PHASE 9: SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Implement system-wide activation with global hotkey
- Create menu bar integration with status item
- Build dock icon behavior and integration
- Develop permissions management and guidance
- Implement Finder integration

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Global Hotkey**:
   - Implement system-wide activation hotkey
   - Create fallback mechanisms for different permission levels
   - Build customizable shortcut configuration
   - Design activation animation and feedback

2. **Menu Bar Icon**:
   - Create status item with menu
   - Implement quick actions
   - Build status visualization
   - Support alternative activation path

3. **Dock Integration**:
   - Build proper dock icon behavior
   - Implement badge notifications
   - Create dock menu with actions
   - Support drag and drop to dock icon

4. **Permissions Management**:
   - Create Full Disk Access guidance
   - Implement permission detection
   - Build progressive permission requests
   - Design permission-aware operation routing

5. **Finder Integration**:
   - Implement reveal in Finder function
   - Create file selection preservation
   - Build contextual operations with Finder
   - Support drag and drop between applications

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Verify hotkey works reliably
   - Test with different permission levels
   - Validate menu bar functions correctly
   - Measure dock integration behavior
   - Verify permissions guidance helps users
   - Test Finder integration across operations
   - Maintain graceful behavior with limited permissions

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS
- Design for resilience against system service failures
- Support fallback mechanisms for each integration
- Maintain functionality with minimal permissions
- Handle system service variations gracefully

## 📋 DEPENDENCIES
- Phase 2 service container
- Phase 3 filesystem operations
- Phase 3 permission bookmarks
- Phase 7 UI framework
