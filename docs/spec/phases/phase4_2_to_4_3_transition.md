# Phase 4.2 to 4.3 Transition: Recommendations and Required Actions

## Overview

This document outlines recommendations and required actions to complete before proceeding from Phase 4.2 (Connection Pool Management) to Phase 4.3 (Migration) in the Panoptikon project. The goal is to ensure technical debt is addressed, code quality and documentation meet project standards, and the codebase is ready for the next phase.

## 1. Pydantic Validator Migration

- **Current State:**
  - The project uses Pydantic version 2 (as specified in `pyproject.toml`).
  - Several configuration models (e.g., `DatabaseConfig` in `src/panoptikon/database/config.py`) still use Pydantic v1-style `@validator` decorators, which are deprecated in v2.
- **Action Required:**
  - Refactor all Pydantic validators to use the v2 `@field_validator` and `@model_validator` APIs.
  - Remove any deprecated usage to ensure future compatibility and eliminate deprecation warnings.

## 2. Code Quality and Documentation

- **Thread-Safety Documentation:**
  - Add or improve docstrings for all public classes and methods in the connection pool code, explicitly stating thread-safety guarantees and limitations.
- **Custom Exception Hierarchy:**
  - Ensure all pool-related errors use a custom exception hierarchy (e.g., `ConnectionPoolError`, `ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout`) and are documented.
- **Context Manager Usage:**
  - Document all context manager usage (for transactions, connections, etc.) in public API docstrings.
- **SQLite Single-Writer Limitation:**
  - Document how the pool handles SQLite's single-writer limitation and what users should expect under write contention.
- **Type Hints and Linting:**
  - Ensure all public functions/classes have type hints and docstrings.
  - Run Black, isort, and Ruff (with --fix) to ensure code style compliance.

## 3. Testing and Performance

- **Test Coverage:**
  - While new code is well-covered, the overall project coverage is only 31%. Increase coverage, especially for modules interacting with the pool, to move toward the 80â€“95% target.
- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Run and document performance tests for connection acquisition under high concurrency (100+ threads), as required by the phase spec.
- **Stress/Leak Testing:**
  - Run stress tests to ensure there are no connection leaks or deadlocks under heavy load.

## 4. Documentation and Migration Readiness

- **Developer Documentation:**
  - Update developer docs and README to reflect the new pool system, configuration options, and usage patterns.
- **API Reference:**
  - Generate or update API reference docs for all new/changed public classes and functions.
- **Migration Plan:**
  - Prepare a migration plan for Phase 4.3, including any schema changes, data migration scripts, and rollback strategies.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Ensure the new pool system is backward compatible with existing database files and configurations.

## 6. Next Steps

- Review and discuss these recommendations with the team.
- Assign action items and owners for each area.
- Complete all required actions before starting Phase 4.3 (Migration).
