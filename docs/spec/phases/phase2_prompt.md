# 🚧 PHASE 2: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Implement service container for dependency injection
- Create event bus for component communication
- Develop configuration system for settings management
- Establish error handling framework
- Build application lifecycle management

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Service Container**:
   - Create ServiceInterface base class
   - Implement container with registration, resolution, and lifecycle hooks
   - Support singleton and transient service lifetimes
   - Add dependency graph validation to prevent circular references

2. **Event Bus**:
   - Design event types and payload structures
   - Implement subscription/publication mechanism
   - Support synchronous and asynchronous event handling
   - Add event logging and replay capabilities for debugging

3. **Configuration System**:
   - Create settings hierarchy (defaults, user, runtime)
   - Implement schema validation for configuration
   - Support hot reloading of configuration changes
   - Add secure storage for sensitive settings

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Create structured error types and categories
   - Implement error reporting and recovery system
   - Design graceful degradation paths
   - Build diagnostic information collection

5. **Application Lifecycle**:
   - Implement startup/shutdown sequence
   - Create service initialization ordering
   - Add resource cleanup on exit
   - Support application state persistence

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Unit tests for all components with 95% coverage
- Service resolution must handle complex dependencies
- Event delivery must be verified across components
- Configuration validation must catch invalid settings
- Error handling must recover from expected failures
- All components must initialize and shutdown cleanly

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS
- No UI or OS-specific code yet
- Maintain platform-independence where possible
- Avoid premature optimization

## 📋 DEPENDENCIES
- Phase 1 project structure and environment
