# üöß PHASE 1: PROJECT INITIALIZATION

## üìù OBJECTIVES
- Create project structure following Python best practices
- Set up Python 3.11+ virtual environment
- Implement linting and type checking
- Configure pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement
- Establish build system for development tasks
- Create documentation structure
- Set up testing framework with coverage requirements

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Create core directory structure (main package, tests, docs, scripts)
   - Set up modular subpackages (core, database, filesystem, search, ui, utils)

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create virtual environment with Python 3.11+
   - Configure pyproject.toml with dependencies:
     - Core: pyobjc-core, pyobjc-framework-*, typing-extensions, click
     - Dev: pytest, mypy, flake8 and plugins, black, pre-commit

3. **Linting Configuration**:
   - flake8: line length 100, complexity 10, strict plugin configuration 
   - mypy: strict typing with disallow_untyped_defs and other strict flags
   - black: consistent formatting with 100 char line length

4. **Pre-commit Setup**:
   - Configure hooks for trailing whitespace, file formats, linting, typing

5. **Build Automation**:
   - Create Makefile with targets: setup, test, lint, format, coverage, clean, build

6. **Documentation Structure**:
   - README with project overview
   - Developer guidelines and standards documentation
   - API documentation templates

7. **Testing Framework**:
   - Configure pytest with markers for unit/integration/performance
   - Set up coverage reporting with 95% target
   - Create initial validation tests

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- All linters must pass without warnings
- Pre-commit hooks must catch non-compliant code
- Project structure must be verified
- Virtual environment must function correctly

## üö´ CONSTRAINTS
- No business logic implementation yet
- Focus only on project structure and tooling
