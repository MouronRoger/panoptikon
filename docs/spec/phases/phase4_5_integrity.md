# 🛡️ PHASE 4.5: DATA INTEGRITY PROTECTION

## 📝 OBJECTIVES
- Configure Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode
- Implement integrity verification system
- Create automated repair mechanisms
- Design backup and recovery processes

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### 1. WAL Configuration 📝
- **Enable WAL Mode**: Better concurrency and crash recovery
- **Checkpoint Strategy**: Automatic and manual checkpoints
- **WAL Size Management**: Prevent unbounded growth
- **Synchronization Modes**: Balance safety vs performance

### 2. Integrity Checking System 🔍
```python
# Integrity verification:
# - PRAGMA integrity_check
# - Foreign key constraint validation
# - Index consistency verification
# - Page-level corruption detection
```

### 3. Automated Repair 🔧
1. Detect corruption patterns
2. Attempt automatic fixes
3. Rebuild corrupted indexes
4. Recreate damaged relationships
5. Fallback to backup restoration

### 4. Backup System 💾
- **Scheduled Backups**: Regular automatic backups
- **Hot Backup**: Using SQLite backup API
- **Compression**: Space-efficient storage
- **Rotation Policy**: Manage backup retention
- **Verification**: Test backup integrity

### 5. Recovery Procedures 🚑
- **Point-in-time Recovery**: WAL-based restoration
- **Selective Restoration**: Table-level recovery
- **Corruption Isolation**: Quarantine bad data
- **Recovery Testing**: Automated recovery drills

## 🧪 TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Test WAL mode configuration
- Verify checkpoint behavior
- Simulate database corruption
- Test automatic repair mechanisms
- Validate backup creation and restoration
- Test recovery procedures
- Measure integrity check performance
- Maintain 95% code coverage

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Zero data loss in crash scenarios
- Integrity checks complete < 2 seconds
- Successful recovery from corruption
- Backup/restore < 10 seconds for 1GB
- Automated repair success rate > 80%

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS
- Use only SQLite built-in features
- Backup size manageable (compressed)
- Recovery time < 30 seconds
- Minimal performance impact in WAL mode

## 📋 DEPENDENCIES
- Phase 4.1-4.4: All database components
- Phase 2: File system operations (backups)
- Phase 2: Scheduling system (automated backups)
- Phase 2: Notification system (alerts)

## 🏗️ CODE STANDARDS
- **Error Handling**: Detailed corruption reporting
- **Logging**: Comprehensive integrity logs
- **Testing**: Corruption simulation framework
- **Documentation**: Recovery procedures
- **Metrics**: Integrity check timings
- **Alerts**: Corruption detection notifications
