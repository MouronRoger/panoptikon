# Revised Implementation Approach for Panoptikon

This document outlines a revised implementation approach for the Panoptikon file search application. The new approach addresses issues with the previous implementation strategy, focusing on incremental development and quality assurance.

## Issues with Previous Approach

The previous implementation approach attempted to implement the entire MVP in a single prompt, which led to several issues:

1. **Too Much at Once**: Asking Claude to implement many components simultaneously
2. **Quality Issues**: Generating code with many linting errors
3. **Inconsistent Implementation**: Difficulty maintaining consistency across components
4. **Overwhelming Complexity**: Trying to handle too many design decisions at once

## Revised Approach

The revised approach follows these key principles:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement one component at a time
2. **Quality First**: Focus on quality over quantity
3. **Verify Before Proceeding**: Test and lint code before moving to the next component
4. **Clear Requirements**: Provide detailed requirements for each component

## Implementation Process

For each component:

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Define interfaces first (classes, methods, functions)
   - Get approval before proceeding to implementation
   - Identify dependencies and integration points

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Implement one file at a time
   - Follow coding standards rigorously
   - Add comprehensive docstrings
   - Include proper error handling

3. **Verification Phase**:
   - Run linters (black, ruff, mypy)
   - Fix any issues
   - Write tests
   - Verify functionality

4. **Integration Phase**:
   - Ensure component works with existing code
   - Check for regressions
   - Document usage patterns

## Project Structure

The project documentation has been reorganized:

```
docs/
├── cursor/                # Cursor AI usage documentation
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── cursor_usage_guide.md
│   ├── implementation_plan.md
│   └── prompt_template.md
├── prompts/               # Implementation prompts
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── component1-file-crawler.md
│   ├── component2-metadata-extractor.md
│   ├── component3-database-schema.md
│   ├── phase0-execution-prompt.md
│   └── phase1-execution-prompt.md
└── implementation_approach.md  # This document
```

## Implementation Order

Components will be implemented in the following order:

1. **FileCrawler**: Recursive directory traversal
2. **MetadataExtractor**: File metadata extraction
3. **Database Schema**: SQLite schema definition
4. **Connection Manager**: Database connection handling
5. **Database Operations**: CRUD operations
6. **Indexing Manager**: Coordinate crawling and database storage
7. **Search Engine Core**: Basic search functionality
8. **Query Parser**: Parse search queries
9. **Filter Builder**: Convert queries to filters
10. **CLI Interface**: Terminal-based interface

This order minimizes dependencies and allows for incremental testing.

## Required Resources

The following resources have been created to support this approach:

1. **Component-Specific Prompts**: Detailed prompts for each component
2. **Cursor Usage Guide**: Best practices for using Cursor AI
3. **Implementation Plan**: Breakdown of tasks and schedule
4. **Prompt Template**: Template for creating component prompts

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation with the FileCrawler component
2. Follow the implementation plan for subsequent components
3. Document progress and update the plan as needed

By following this structured approach, we expect to create a high-quality implementation of Panoptikon with fewer errors and improved maintainability.
