    "text": "# AI Documentation Guide - Panoptikon\n\n**IMPORTANT: The only canonical source of project documentation is the Markdown files in `/docs`, which are automatically indexed to the Qdrant cloud instance (`panoptikon` collection) for semantic search and MCP server integration. All documentation creation, updates, and queries must go through this system. Do not use local Qdrant, ad-hoc scripts, or any other memory system for canonical documentation.**\n\nThis guide provides comprehensive information about the Panoptikon documentation system, which uses Qdrant for semantic search and integrates with the MCP server.\n\n## System Overview\n\nThe Panoptikon project uses a unified Qdrant-based documentation system for all documentation storage, indexing, and retrieval.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Qdrant Cloud Instance**\n   - **Collection Name**: `panoptikon` (unified for all documentation)\n   - **Vector Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)\n   - **Vector Name** (for MCP): `fast-all-minilm-l6-v2`\n   - **URL**: Configured in scripts\n\n2. **Documentation Scripts**\n   - **Primary Interface**: `/scripts/documentation/ai_docs.py`\n     - Main AI-accessible interface for documentation\n     - Automatically creates markdown files and indexes them in Qdrant\n     - Provides functions for creating, updating, searching documentation\n   \n   - **Utility Scripts**: `/scripts/qdrant/`\n     - `index_docs_mcp.py` - MCP-compatible indexing with named vectors (cloud only)\n     - `test_mcp.py` - Test MCP integration\n     - `qdrant.sh` - Wrapper script for all MCP-compatible operations\n\n3. **MCP Server Integration**\n   - Uses the `panoptikon` collection\n   - Provides semantic search capabilities\n   - Requires `document` field in payload\n   - Syncs automatically when documents are created/updated\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```python\n# Import the documentation system\nfrom scripts.documentation.ai_docs import *\n\n# Create new documentation\ncreate_documentation(\n    category=\"components\",\n    title=\"Event Bus\",\n    content=\"# Event Bus\\n\\nThe event bus provides pub/sub communication...\",\n    tags=[\"core\", \"messaging\"],\n    status=\"completed\"\n)\n\n# Read existing documentation\ndoc = read_documentation(\"components\", \"Event Bus\")\nprint(doc['content'])\n\n# Update documentation\nupdate_documentation(\n    category=\"components\",\n    title=\"Event Bus\",\n    updates={\n        'content': \"# Event Bus\\n\\nUpdated content...\",\n        'metadata': {'status': 'updated', 'version': '2.0'}\n    }\n)\n\n# Search documentation using Qdrant semantic search\nresults = search_documentation(\"database connection pooling\")\nfor result in results:\n    print(f\"{result['title']} - {result['score']}\")\n\n# Document a component\ndocument_component(\n    \"ServiceContainer\",\n    overview=\"Dependency injection container\",\n    purpose=\"Manage service lifecycles\",\n    implementation=\"Uses singleton pattern\",\n    status=\"Completed\",\n    coverage=\"94%\"\n)\n\n# Document a phase\ndocument_phase(\n    \"Stage 4 - Database Implementation\",\n    objectives=\"Implement SQLite database layer\",\n    components=[\"Schema\", \"Connection Pool\", \"Migration System\"],\n    status=\"In Progress\",\n    progress=\"Stage 4.1 complete, 4.2 needs testing\"\n)\n\n# Record an architecture decision\nrecord_decision(\n    \"Use SQLite for Storage\",\n    status=\"Accepted\",\n    context=\"Need fast, embedded database\",\n    decision=\"Use SQLite with WAL mode\",\n    consequences=\"Single writer limitation\",\n    alternatives=[\"PostgreSQL\", \"LevelDB\"]\n)\n\n# Update progress\nupdate_phase_progress(\n    \"Stage 4\",\n    status=\"In Progress\",\n    completed=[\"Schema implementation\", \"Connection pool\"],\n    issues=[\"Missing test coverage\"],\n    next=[\"Write tests\", \"Start migration system\"]\n)\n```\n\n## Available Functions\n\nAll functions automatically sync with the Qdrant cloud instance:\n\n1. `create_documentation(category, title, content, **metadata)` - Creates and indexes new docs\n2. `read_documentation(category, title)` - Reads from local files\n3. `update_documentation(category, title, updates)` - Updates and re-indexes docs\n4. `search_documentation(query, limit=5)` - Semantic search via Qdrant\n5. `document_component(name, **details)` - Create component documentation\n6. `document_phase(name, **details)` - Create stage documentation\n7. `record_decision(title, **decision_details)` - Create ADR (Architecture Decision Record)\n8. `update_phase_progress(phase, **updates)` - Update stage progress tracking\n\n## Document Categories\n\nAll documents are organized in these directories and indexed in Qdrant:\n\n- `architecture` - System design documentation\n- `components` - Individual component docs\n- `phases` - Project phase documentation\n- `testing` - Test plans and coverage\n- `api` - API documentation\n- `guides` - How-to guides\n- `decisions` - Architecture Decision Records\n- `progress` - Progress tracking\n\n## Technical Configuration\n\n### Qdrant Integration\n- **Collection**: `panoptikon`\n- **Cloud Instance**: Configured in scripts/documentation/ai_docs.py\n- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)\n- **Automatic Indexing**: All documentation is automatically indexed on creation/update\n- **Vector Configuration**: Named vectors for MCP compatibility\n\n### Manual Operations\n\nFor manual operations, use the scripts in `scripts/qdrant/`:\n\n```bash\n# Index all documentation (MCP-compatible, cloud only)\ncd scripts/qdrant\n./qdrant.sh index\n\n# Test MCP integration\n./qdrant.sh test\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. **Single Collection**: Everything uses the `panoptikon` collection\n2. **No Local Qdrant**: Always use the cloud instance\n3. **Automatic Indexing**: The ai_docs.py system automatically indexes on create/update\n4. **MCP Compatible**: The system is fully integrated with the MCP server\n5. **Document Field**: All indexed documents include a `document` field for MCP compatibility\n\n## Migration Status\n\n- \u2705 All scripts updated to use `panoptikon` collection\n- \u2705 AI documentation interface updated\n- \u2705 Cursor rules updated\n- \u2705 Old references to `panoptikon_docs` removed\n- \u2705 Scripts consolidated in `/scripts/documentation/` and `/scripts/qdrant/`\n- \u2705 MCP integration working with proper `document` field\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nscripts/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 documentation/         # AI documentation tools\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ai_docs.py        # Main AI documentation interface\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 record_transition.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 migrate_kg_to_docs.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 migrate_complete.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 simple_migrate.py\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 qdrant/               # Qdrant indexing tools\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 index_docs_mcp.py # MCP-compatible indexing\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_mcp.py       # MCP testing\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 qdrant.sh         # Wrapper script\n```\n\n## Packaging for Other Projects\n\nTo use this documentation system in other projects:\n\n1. Copy the `scripts/documentation/` and `scripts/qdrant/` directories\n2. Update the Qdrant credentials and collection name in the scripts\n3. Create the necessary documentation directories (`docs/architecture`, etc.)\n4. Run `./qdrant.sh index` to start indexing documentation\n\nThe system is designed to be self-contained and easily portable to other repositories.\n\n## Cleanup of Old Directories\n\nAfter the migration to the unified system, these old directories can be removed:\n\n```bash\n# Remove old directories (manual action required)\nrm -rf scripts/qdrant-utils/\nrm -rf qdrant_storage/\n```\n\n## System Consolidation and Cleanup\n\nThe Panoptikon documentation system has undergone a full consolidation and migration to a unified, Qdrant-backed architecture. This section summarizes the actions taken, deprecated files, and next steps. This section supersedes the previous `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` file.\n\n### Actions Taken\n- All documentation scripts and interfaces are now located in `scripts/documentation/` and `scripts/qdrant/`.\n- The Qdrant collection name is standardized as `panoptikon`.\n- All documentation is indexed and accessed via the unified Qdrant cloud instance.\n- Redundant scripts and files have been removed or replaced by the new system.\n\n### Deprecated/Removed Files\n- `migrate_docs.py` (root) \u2014 replaced by new workflow\n- `scripts/docs_pipeline.py` \u2014 replaced by new workflow\n- `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` \u2014 content merged here\n\n### Next Steps\n- Delete any remaining deprecated files listed above if present.\n- Ensure `.DS_Store` and other OS metadata files are removed and ignored via `.gitignore`.\n- Move technical notes (e.g., PyObjC typing) to `docs/guides/` or merge into onboarding documentation.\n- Normalize filenames (e.g., remove leading `#` from `# Panoptikon Code Error Priority List.md`).\n\nThe system is now fully consolidated with a single approach to documentation management.

All technical debt and documentation requirements for Stage 4.2 have been addressed as per the transition spec.\n- **Next Steps:**\n    - Start implementation of schema migration system (#todo)\n    - Develop and test migration scripts (#todo)\n    - Document migration process and update progress in documentation (#todo)\n    - Monitor for any issues during migration and address promptly (#todo)\n\n## [2024-06-12 10:00] #phase4.1 #phase6 #phase7 #decision #done #usp\n- **Phase:** 4.1 (Database Schema), 6 (Indexing), 7 (UI Framework)\n- **Summary:** Promoted folder size calculation, display, and sorting to a core deliverable. Updated the client specification, roadmap, and all relevant stage documents to make folder size a first-class feature. Implementation will be staged: (1) add `folder_size` column and index to the database schema, (2) implement recursive folder size calculation and incremental updates in the indexer, (3) display and sort by folder size in the UI. All changes reference the integration report and competitive analysis.\n- **Tags:** #done #decision #usp #spec #roadmap #migration #rationale\n- **Rationale:** Folder size is a unique selling point not offered by competitors. Integration report and user research confirm its value. Early implementation ensures architectural alignment and maximizes user impact.\n- **Next Steps:**\n    - Implement schema migration for `folder_size` (Phase 4.1)\n    - Add recursive folder size calculation and incremental updates (Phase 6)\n    - Update UI to display and sort by folder size (Phase 7)\n    - Add tests for accuracy and performance\n    - Track progress and log all major actions in documentation system \n\n## [2024-06-12 13:30] #phase4.3 #migration-framework #milestone #done #migration #rationale\n- **Phase:** 4.3 (Schema Migration Framework)\n- **Subphase:** Migration System Core, Safety, Recovery, and 1.1.0 Folder Size Migration\n- **Summary:**\n    - Implemented automated schema versioning and migration registry (#done)\n    - Developed migration executor with backup, rollback, and verification (#done)\n    - Added pre-migration backup, transaction-wrapped migrations, and post-migration verification (#done)\n    - Implemented automatic rollback and recovery on migration failure (#done)\n    - Migration lock prevents concurrent runs (#done)\n    - Migration for schema version 1.1.0 (folder_size column and index) implemented and tested (#done)\n    - All migration logic is idempotent and safe for repeated runs (#done)\n    - Comprehensive tests for sequential migration, rollback, recovery, idempotency, and corrupted states (#done)\n    - All code and tests meet project standards (Black, isort, Ruff, mypy --strict) (#done)\n    - Documentation updated to reflect migration system and folder_size feature (#done)\n- **Tags:** #done #milestone #migration #rationale #recovery #rollback #safety #idempotent\n- **Rationale:**\n    - Robust migration system is critical for safe schema evolution and user data integrity. Automated recovery and rollback ensure zero data loss. Idempotency and locking prevent accidental corruption. The folder_size migration is a dependency for future indexing and UI features.\n- **Next Steps:**\n    - Monitor for migration issues in real-world usage (#todo)\n    - Begin Stage 6: Implement folder size calculation and incremental updates (#todo)\n    - Prepare UI changes for folder size display and sorting (Stage 7) (#todo)\n    - Continue to log all progress and decisions in the documentation system (#milestone) \n\n## [2024-06-12 15:30] #phase7 #ui #decision #done #testing #pyobjc #rationale\n- **Phase:** 7 (UI Framework)\n- **Summary:**\n    - Implemented robust conditional import/skip logic in `tests/ui/test_ui_integration.py` to ensure pytest never collects or runs UI integration tests if PyObjC is not available.\n    - The solution checks for PyObjC at the very top of the file, sets `__test__ = False`, defines a dummy function, and exits immediately if PyObjC is missing.\n    - All pytest-specific imports and test code are placed below the check, so pytest never sees them if PyObjC is unavailable.\n    - Added a detailed module-level docstring explaining the rationale, maintenance requirements, and usage for future developers.\n    - This approach is robust, cross-platform, and future-proof, and avoids all issues with pytest collection, mocking, and skip logic.\n- **Tags:** #done #decision #testing #pyobjc #rationale\n- **Rationale:**\n    - Previous skip/ignore mechanisms failed due to pytest's collection and parsing order and extensive mocking.\n    - This pattern guarantees the file is invisible to pytest if PyObjC is not present, preventing confusing failures and maintenance headaches.\n- **Next Steps:**\n    - Document this pattern in developer onboarding and testing guides.\n    - Apply similar patterns to other conditional test modules if needed. \n\n## [2024-06-11 14:00] #phase4.3 #schema-migration #assessment #done #milestone\n- **Phase:** 4.3 (Schema Migration Framework)\n- **Summary:** Stage 4.3 is now complete. All objectives for the schema migration framework have been met, including automated schema versioning, forward migration execution, backup and recovery, and safe rollback. The migration system is fully tested (95%+ coverage), supports atomic migrations, and maintains a clear migration history. No data loss was observed in all test scenarios. Migration time is under 5 seconds for typical schemas. All code and documentation standards have been followed.\n- **Rationale:** Completing this stage ensures robust, safe, and auditable schema evolution for the Panoptikon database, enabling future features and maintenance with confidence.\n- **Tags:** #done #milestone #assessment #migration #testing #rationale\n- **Next Steps:**\n    - Begin planning and implementation for Phase 5 (Integration)\n    - Monitor for any migration-related issues in production (#todo)\n    - Update user and developer documentation to reflect migration capabilities (#todo)",

This feature represents a significant USP (Unique Selling Proposition) that neither Everything nor native file explorers offer effectively. The required refactoring is minimal since the feature is already part of the specification.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Current Status\n\n### Already in Spec \u2705\n- **Client Specification** explicitly mentions: *\"Folder size calculation is supported where possible\"*\n- Listed as one of the available columns in the UI\n- Part of the flexible column customization feature set\n\n### Not Yet Implemented \u274c\n- Database schema lacks folder size field\n- Indexing system doesn't calculate folder sizes\n- UI doesn't display folder sizes\n\n## \ud83d\udccd Where It Fits in the Roadmap\n\n### Phase Placement\n\n**Target Phase: Phase 6 (Indexing System)**\n- **Rationale**: Folder size calculation is naturally part of the indexing process\n- **Current Status**: Phase 6 is scheduled for weeks 3-5 (Development Stage 2)\n- **Dependencies**: Requires Phase 4 database enhancements (currently in progress)\n\n### Specific Integration Points\n\n1. **Phase 4.1 (Database Schema)** - Week 3\n   - Add `folder_size INTEGER` field to `files` table for directories\n   - Add index on folder sizes for efficient sorting\n   - Minor schema version bump (1.0.0 \u2192 1.1.0)\n\n2. **Phase 6 (Indexing System)** - Weeks 3-5\n   - Implement recursive folder size calculation during initial scan\n   - Add incremental size updates when files change\n   - Cache folder sizes in database\n   - Handle edge cases (hard links, symlinks)\n\n3. **Phase 7 (UI Framework)** - Weeks 6-8  \n   - Display folder sizes in the Size column\n   - Ensure proper formatting (KB/MB/GB)\n   - Enable sorting by folder size\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 Required Refactoring\n\n### Database Changes (Phase 4)\n```sql\n-- Add to files table\nALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN folder_size INTEGER;\n\n-- Add performance index\nCREATE INDEX idx_files_folder_size ON files(folder_size);\n\n-- Update schema version\nUPDATE schema_version SET version = '1.1.0';\n```\n\n### Indexing Changes (Phase 6)\n- Modify scanner to calculate folder sizes recursively\n- Update FSEvents handler to maintain size accuracy\n- Add batch update optimization for large directories\n\n### UI Changes (Phase 7)\n- Update table view to show folder sizes\n- Add proper number formatting\n- Enable column sorting by size\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 Impact Analysis\n\n### Performance Impact\n- **Initial Indexing**: ~15-20% slower (acceptable trade-off)\n- **Incremental Updates**: Minimal impact\n- **Query Performance**: No degradation with proper indexing\n- **Memory Usage**: Minor increase for size tracking\n\n### User Experience Benefits\n- **Instant folder sizes** without right-click delays\n- **Sortable by size** to find space hogs quickly\n- **Major differentiator** from competitors\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 4 Enhancement (Current)\n1. Add folder_size column to schema\n2. Update SchemaManager with new field\n3. Bump schema version\n4. Write migration script\n\n### Phase 6 Integration (Next)\n1. Implement recursive size calculator\n2. Add size tracking to indexer\n3. Handle incremental updates\n4. Optimize for performance\n\n### Phase 7 Display (Following)\n1. Update TableViewWrapper columns\n2. Add size formatting utilities\n3. Enable sorting functionality\n\n## \u23f1\ufe0f Timeline Impact\n\n- **Phase 4 Addition**: +1 day\n- **Phase 6 Integration**: +2-3 days\n- **Phase 7 Updates**: +1 day\n- **Total Impact**: ~5 days added to existing phases\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Success Metrics\n\n1. Folder sizes calculated for 250k files in <2 minutes\n2. Size updates complete within 50ms of file changes\n3. Zero performance impact on search operations\n4. 100% accuracy compared to OS calculations\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Recommendations\n\n1. **Implement in Phase 4.1** - Add database field now while schema work is active\n2. **Plan for Phase 6** - Design folder size calculation as core indexing feature\n3. **Test early** - Validate performance assumptions with large datasets\n4. **Market as USP** - Highlight this unique capability in release materials\n\n## \u2705 Conclusion\n\nFolder size calculation is:\n- **Already specified** in your client requirements\n- **Minimal refactoring** needed (mostly additions)\n- **High value** feature that differentiates Panoptikon\n- **Well-timed** to implement during current database work\n\nThe feature aligns perfectly with your \"no blindspots\" philosophy - Panoptikon knows everything about your files, including how much space folders consume, without requiring any manual calculation.",

Overview\n\nThis roadmap outlines the development process for Panoptikon, a high-performance macOS filename search utility. It provides a structured approach for a single developer working with Cursor AI to implement the system architecture and deliver the Phase 1 MVP while strategically bulletproofing only the most critical OS-dependent components.\n\nThe roadmap is organized into **Development Phases** (timeline-based milestones) and **Stages** (detailed implementation units). Each phase encompasses specific stages, building upon the previous ones while maintaining testability, quality, and focused OS resilience throughout the process.\n\n## 2.

Testing Strategy\n\n[Rest of document continues unchanged...]\n\n## 10. Conclusion\n\nThis development roadmap provides a structured approach to delivering Panoptikon using a clear hierarchy of Development Phases (timeline milestones) and Stages (implementation details). By organizing the work into these two levels, the plan offers both high-level progress tracking and detailed implementation guidance.\n\nThe emphasis on early implementation of high-risk components, multiple implementation strategies for volatile OS interfaces, and comprehensive testing will ensure a high-quality, performant, and resilient application that delivers on the promise: \"it knows where everything is with no blindspots.\"",

    "text": "# \ud83d\udcd1 **Panoptikon Client Specification**\n\n## \ud83d\udccb **Release Strategy and Core Philosophy**\n\n**Stage 1 Focus - Minimal \"Everything\" Clone**: The initial release of Panoptikon will deliver a focused, high-performance file search application that indexes and searches by filename only, similar to the popular Windows utility \"Everything\". This approach prioritizes speed, reliability, and immediate utility while establishing the architectural foundation for future enhancements.\n\n**Core Design Philosophy**: \"The idea of the Panoptikon is that it knows where everything is. It has no blindspots.\" The application must provide comprehensive visibility across all file storage locations with zero configuration, delivering instant results regardless of where files are stored.\n\n**Deferred Capabilities**: Content indexing, OCR, full-text search, advanced boolean operators, intelligent ranking, CLI integration, watch queries, and metadata filtering are explicitly deferred to future releases. The architecture will be designed with extension points to ensure these capabilities can be added later without significant refactoring.\n\n**Essential Core Features**: The initial release will focus exclusively on ultra-fast filename search, customizable tabs, basic filtering options, seamless cloud integration, flexible column customization, and native macOS integration with Finder.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **Purpose and Scope**\n\nPanoptikon is a fast, lightweight file-search application for macOS, designed to help individual users reclaim control over scattered data. By day one, it must deliver an intuitive, high-performance search experience that locates files by name across local disks, network shares, and popular cloud services. This document captures, in concrete terms, every requirement Panoptikon must deliver before any technical architecture work begins. Its language is precise and measurable, ensuring no requirement remains open to interpretation.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **Target Audience**\n\nPanoptikon serves three primary user groups: students managing research papers and lecture notes; home users organizing personal documents and media; and home-office workers handling reports, spreadsheets, and contracts. It explicitly excludes specialized workflows such as film editing, music production, or real-time collaboration.\n\n## \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f **Context of Use**\n\nA user invokes Panoptikon via a global hotkey, the menu-bar icon, or the Dock. Within a fraction of a second, a minimalist window appears with the search field focused. As the user types a filename fragment, matching entries populate instantly in a familiar list view. Users accustomed to macOS drag-and-drop and Finder context menus feel at home immediately; those switching from Windows recognize the responsiveness reminiscent of \"Everything.\"\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **User Interface and Design**\n\n**Tabbed Layout**: Search results display within a tabbed interface at the top of the window. Tabs default to categories (All Files, Documents, Spreadsheets, PDFs, Folders, Images, Audio, Video, Archive, Apps, Custom) and can be user-defined. Switching tabs filters results by predefined or custom criteria without losing the search query.\n\n**Customizable Tabs (Preset, Not Hardcoded)**: The default tab set (All Files, Documents, PDFs, etc.) is provided as a starting point but is not fixed. Users can rename, delete, reorder, or add tabs via contextual interaction. Each tab maps to a saved filter configuration\u2014by file type, extension, or path rules\u2014which the user can modify directly. Tab definitions persist across sessions and reflect user preferences without requiring reconfiguration.\n\n**Columns and Context Menus**: The default columns\u2014Name, Type, Extension, Size, Date Created, Date Modified, Path, and Cloud Status\u2014appear in a sortable list. Users may reveal, hide, and reorder columns through direct manipulation of the header. Right-clicking or two-finger tapping any row exposes Finder-consistent commands: Open, Open With\u2026, Reveal in Finder, Quick Look, Copy Path, and Move to Trash. All commands apply seamlessly to multiple selected rows.\n\n***Dual Input Method Support***: The interface provides ***equal emphasis on keyboard shortcuts for Mac power users alongside comprehensive right-click context menus for Windows migrants***. ***Mouse hover tooltips assist Windows users unfamiliar with Mac conventions***, while ***visual indicators clearly show all available actions accessible via both mouse and keyboard methods***. This dual-input design ensures both user groups can operate efficiently according to their established habits.\n\n***Interaction Consistency***: The application ***maintains Mac interface conventions while simultaneously providing familiar Windows equivalents***. Drag-and-drop operations ***behave exactly as expected in Finder while offering familiar feedback for Windows users***. The interface includes a ***status bar with information presentation familiar to Windows users without compromising Mac aesthetics***. The application ***supports both Mac trackpad gestures and Windows-style mouse wheel behaviors*** for navigation and interaction.\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f **Functional Requirements**\n\n**Search Filtering by Filename**: The search field filters by filename alone, updating results with no perceptible lag and smooth, flicker-free rendering. As the core functionality of Stage 1, this capability must be optimized for maximum performance and reliability.\n\n**Basic Search Capabilities**: Panoptikon supports simple, intuitive search patterns that focus on filename matching. Core search functionality includes:\n\n* Wildcard patterns (\\*, ?) for flexible filename matching\n* Case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching via a simple toggle\n* Whole word matching via a simple toggle\n* Extension filtering via a dedicated adjacent field for quick `*.extension` searches\n\nComplex boolean operators and special syntax are intentionally omitted to maintain simplicity and performance.\n\n**Bookmarks and Favorites**: Users can bookmark frequently accessed files, folders, or searches for rapid access. Bookmarks persist across sessions and can be organized within the interface. This feature provides quick access to important items without requiring complex search history management.\n\n**Path Inclusion/Exclusion Logic**: Users can define include and exclude rules for file paths. Include rules accept specific folders or volumes; exclude rules omit specified directories, subtrees, or mount points. The UI exposes a preferences panel where users add, edit, and reorder path rules. Exclude rules take precedence over include rules.\n\n**File Type Inclusion/Exclusion Filters**: Beyond tabs, users can create custom file-type filters by specifying extensions or MIME types. These filters integrate with tabs and can be toggled in the preferences panel, enabling or disabling types globally or per tab.\n\n**Granular Inclusion/Exclusion Control**: The system allows for fine-grained control where users can exclude specific paths, files, and filetypes while including others. ***Importantly, the system supports hierarchical overrides where a child directory can be explicitly included even when its parent directory is excluded***. This capability is especially relevant for cloud storage files typically stored in system locations like the .library folder, allowing users to include cloud documents without indexing the entire system directory structure.\n\n**Indexing Progress Indicator**: During initial indexing or manual updates, a non-intrusive progress indicator displays percent-complete and estimated time remaining. Users may pause or throttle indexing threads via preferences to control resource usage.\n\n***Visual Disambiguation***: The interface provides ***clear visual distinction for files with identical names in different locations***, ensuring users can immediately identify the specific file they need. ***Path information is immediately visible without requiring additional clicks or hover actions***. The system provides ***instant visual feedback when typing matches zero files***, and includes ***progressive loading indicators for very large result sets*** to maintain responsive feel.\n\n## \u2601\ufe0f **Cloud and Network Integration**\n\nPanoptikon's index includes files on internal drives, connected external volumes, network shares, and supported cloud providers\u2014iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Box. Files downloaded to disk display on a neutral background; placeholders for cloud-only items appear tinted, with a tooltip explaining that the file must be hydrated before opening. Rows for unavailable network volumes appear dimmed and revive instantly once the volume reconnects.\n\n**Seamless Cloud Delegation**: Panoptikon does not directly integrate each cloud provider's API. Instead, it delegates file hydration and opening to the system's native integration or provider-specific helper, invoking a single standard call to reveal or open a file path. This approach ensures a transparent, consistent user experience where cloud document downloads and opening are deferred seamlessly and invisibly to Finder. The user should never need to consider whether a file is cloud-based or local\u2014Panoptikon knows where everything is with no blindspots, and handles the details transparently.\n\n## \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f **Database and Caching**\n\nPanoptikon maintains a local, lightweight database to store file index metadata. This database persists between launches, supports incremental updates driven by filesystem events, and caches information about offline or cloud-only files to avoid costly full re-indexing. When a network or cloud file is unavailable, its metadata remains accessible in the database so that the app can display placeholder entries instantly and hydrate files on demand without delaying search results.\n\n**Future-Proof Database Design**: While the initial release focuses on filename indexing only, the database schema will be designed with extensibility in mind, including provisions for future content-based search capabilities **and folder size calculation**. This forward-looking approach ensures that future enhancements can be added without requiring database migration or redesign.\n\n## \u26a1 **Performance and Resource Constraints**\n\nInitial indexing of up to 250,000 files shall complete in under one minute on an Apple Silicon MacBook Air, consuming no more than twenty percent of a single CPU core and 500 MB of RAM. Incremental updates driven by filesystem events must never block the UI and must process batches in under fifty milliseconds. From final keystroke to fully rendered results, search latency must remain below fifty milliseconds for indexes up to 250,000 entries. Launch time from invoking the hotkey to a focused search field must stay under one hundred milliseconds under normal system load. When idle, Panoptikon's resident memory footprint must remain below fifty megabytes and CPU usage must be negligible.\n\n***Speed Benchmarks From User Perspective***: To ensure the application feels instantaneous to users, the following metrics must be met: ***\"no perceptible lag\" is defined as under 16ms (one frame) response time between user action and visible feedback***; ***\"instant appearance\" requires first results to be visible within 50ms of keystroke***; ***complete result set updates must occur within 100ms maximum***; and ***UI rendering must maintain minimum 60fps during typing and scrolling operations***. These benchmarks ensure the application feels native and responsive to both Mac and Windows users accustomed to high-performance search.\n\n## \ud83c\udf10 **Accessibility, Internationalization, and Localization**\n\nEvery control carries an accessibility label and is fully operable via VoiceOver and keyboard alone, enabling users to perform searches, apply filters, execute context commands, switch tabs, and quit the app without a pointing device. All user-visible text loads from localization files; the initial languages supported are English, French, and German. The interface respects system settings for Dark Mode, increased contrast, and dynamic type sizes.\n\n## \ud83d\udd12 **Privacy, Permissions, and Security**\n\nPanoptikon's entire index resides locally within the user's Library container and, if FileVault is enabled, benefits from disk encryption. Under no circumstances does the app transmit filenames, paths, or usage metrics off-device. On first launch, Panoptikon requests Full Disk Access through standard macOS entitlements. If the user declines, the app continues to index accessible locations and displays a non-intrusive banner explaining reduced visibility, with a link to help documentation. The application bundle is notarized, sandboxed, and signed with a Developer ID certificate. Updates are delivered securely via Sparkle with ed25519 verification.\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 **Platform Support and Non-Functional Constraints**\n\nPanoptikon supports macOS 13 (Ventura) and later, on both Apple Silicon and Intel architectures. Continuous integration tests enforce all performance metrics and fail the build on regression. User data structures are resilient to sudden power loss; index rebuilds occur only on first launch or after a verified corruption event. The codebase adheres to native Apple Human Interface Guidelines, ensuring a polished, familiar experience.\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f **Architectural Decisions**\n\n**Stage 1 Focus**: Stage 1 will implement fast, filename-only search with all advanced search filters\u2014boolean logic, date range, and size range. The architecture will establish clear boundaries between index management, search operations, and UI components, with well-defined interfaces to support future capabilities.\n\n**Deferred Features**: Content indexing, OCR, and full-text search capabilities are deliberately deferred to future stages. However, the architecture will be designed with these capabilities in mind, with clear extension points identified during the design phase.\n\n**Technical Foundations**: Offline network volumes and cloud\u2011only files leverage the lightweight database cache to guarantee sub\u2011100 ms response times. Duplicate filenames remain separate entries; grouping modes and further UI refinements will be revisited in post\u20111.0 updates.\n\n## \u2b50 **Additional User-Centric Features**\n\n**Inline Preview Pane**: A resizable side panel displays Quick Look previews (text, PDF, image, audio waveforms, video thumbnails) for the selected file without opening a separate window.\n\n**Content Search Option (Future Phase)**: In future releases, Panoptikon will expand beyond filename search to include content indexing capabilities. This will enable users to search within file contents (text, PDF, Office docs) with appropriate resource management controls. Similarly, OCR-powered text extraction for images and scanned PDFs will be implemented in a future phase. The Stage 1 architecture will be designed with these capabilities in mind to ensure smooth integration when implemented.\n\n**Drag and Drop Support**: Comprehensive drag and drop functionality is supported throughout the application:\n* Drag files from results to Finder or other applications\n* Drag files between multiple Panoptikon windows\n* Drag files to the Dock, Desktop, or folders\nThis integration with macOS's native drag and drop capabilities ensures seamless workflow integration.\n\n**File Information Display**: Basic file metadata (size, dates, extension, type) is displayed in the results list through customizable columns. Advanced metadata filtering and tag-based searches are deferred to future releases to maintain focus on core filename search functionality.\n\n**Favorites and Pinned Searches**: Users can mark folders or files as favorites for rapid access and pin saved searches to the UI toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts allow quick jumping to favorites or pinned queries.\n\n**Keyboard-Driven Workflow**: Complete operation via keyboard: global hotkey to invoke search, arrow keys to navigate results, Return to open, spacebar to Quick Look, and customizable shortcuts for context commands.\n\n**Rich Context Menu Options**: Right-click context menus provide essential file operations including:\n* Open\n* Open with...\n* Reveal in Finder\n* Copy path (full path to clipboard)\n* Copy filename (just the filename to clipboard)\n* Move to Trash\nThese operations apply seamlessly to multiple selected files.\n\n**Multi-Window Support**: Users can open multiple Panoptikon windows simultaneously, each with independent search queries and result views. Drag and drop operations are supported both within and between windows, enabling efficient file management workflows.\n\n**Flexible Column Customization**: The results view offers comprehensive column customization:\n* Users can show/hide individual columns\n* Available columns include: Name, Path, Size, Extension, Type, Date Modified, Date Created, Date Accessed, and Run Count\n* **Folder size calculation is supported where possible (see Integration Report).**\n* Columns are sortable by clicking headers, including by folder size\n* Column positions can be changed via drag and drop\n* Column preferences persist across sessions\n\n**Import/Export Settings**: Preferences, bookmarks, inclusion/exclusion rules, and column configurations are exportable to a JSON settings file for backup or sharing.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **Default Sorting and User Control**\n\n**Simple, Predictable Sorting**: By default, search results are sorted by most recently modified files at the top, followed by alphabetical ordering. This approach ensures the most relevant files typically appear first without complex ranking algorithms.\n\n**User-Controlled Sorting**: Users can manually sort the results by clicking any column header (Name, Date Modified, Size, **Folder Size**, etc.) to change the sort order. This gives direct control over result organization without automatic or \"intelligent\" intervention.\n\n**Basic Run Count Tracking**: The system maintains a simple count of file opens to support the \"Run Count\" column, but does not implement complex usage analytics or predictive sorting.\n\n## \u2705 **Success Criteria**\n\n**Stage 1 Success Criteria**: Panoptikon is production-ready when an unbiased tester with 250,000 files can:\n1. Launch the search window\n2. Find a specified file by filename\n3. Open it in under one second end-to-end\n4. Successfully work with local, network, and cloud files without configuration\n5. **See folder sizes for all directories instantly and sort by folder size**\n6. Perform the above while macOS's Activity Monitor never flags Panoptikon as a top resource consumer\n\nThis criterion focuses exclusively on filename-based search performance and comprehensive file system visibility, aligning with the \"no blindspots\" philosophy and Stage 1 scope.\n\n**Future Stage Success Criteria**: Success criteria for content indexing and OCR capabilities will be defined in future specification updates. The architecture must be designed to accommodate these capabilities without compromising the core performance metrics established for Stage 1.\n\n**Additional Scalability Goal (Optional)**: The system should handle larger indexes gracefully for power users, scaling up to 1,000,000 files with proportional performance, documented as aspirational targets.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **System\u2011Designer Instructions (KISS & Land Rover Philosophy)**\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 **Target users**\n\nConsumers; students; home and small\u2011office workers; busy secretaries and administrators; small\u2011business managers.\n\n### \ud83d\udeab **Non\u2011targets**\n\nLarge enterprises; media producers; software developers.\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 **Guiding principles**\n\nSimplicity; robustness; zero surprises; no bloat; essentials only; every line must be justified by daily utility.\n\n### \ud83d\udd29 **Coding standards**\n\nPython 3.11 + PyObjC; single\u2011purpose modules; hard limit 500 lines per file; PEP 8 plus strict linting; cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function; no dead code tolerated; commits rejected if mypy or flake8 emit warnings.\n\n### \ud83e\uddea **Testing & build pipeline**\n\nTests accompany every module; unit coverage \u2265 95 % with pytest; integration smoke test after each merge; CI stops on first error; artefacts versioned and checksummed; refactors forbidden during stabilisation; critical\u2011path tasks mapped and gated.\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 **Packaging workflow**\n\nPrototype with editable PyObjC sources; strip to essentials; avoid external pip packages unless unavoidable (each usage must be justified and reviewed).

Implementation Strategy\n\n### 4.1 Core Components\n\n1. **DualWindowManager (Singleton)**\n   ```python\n   class DualWindowManager:\n       - active_window: \"main\" | \"secondary\"\n       - main_window_state: WindowState\n       - secondary_window_state: Optional[WindowState]\n       - activate_main_window()\n       - activate_secondary_window()\n       - toggle_secondary_window()\n       - coordinate_drag_operation(is_from_main_window, files)\n   ```\n\n2. **WindowState**\n   ```python\n   class WindowState:\n       - is_main: bool\n       - is_active: bool\n       - search_query: str\n       - active_tab: TabIdentifier\n       - selected_files: List[FileReference]\n       - scroll_position: CGPoint\n   ```\n\n3. **Resource Management**\n   - File system monitoring: Active window only\n   - Search result caching: Inactive window\n   - Event processing: Suspended for inactive window\n\n### 4.2 Integration Points\n\n1. **Service Container** (Stage 2)\n   - Register DualWindowManager as singleton service\n   - Inject into UI components\n\n2. **Event Bus** (Stage 2)\n   - WindowActivatedEvent\n   - SecondaryWindowCreatedEvent\n   - SecondaryWindowClosedEvent\n   - CrossWindowDragEvent\n\n3. **File System** (Stage 3)\n   - Coordinate file operations across windows\n   - Manage watcher resources per window\n\n4. **Database** (Stage 4)\n   - Share connection pool across windows\n   - Cache queries per window state\n\n## 5. Risk Mitigation\n\n### 5.1 Technical Risks\n\n1. **Memory Management**\n   - Risk: Excessive memory usage with secondary window\n   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching limits, lazy loading\n\n2. **Resource Contention**\n   - Risk: File handle conflicts between windows\n   - Mitigation: Centralized file operation queue\n\n3. **State Synchronization**\n   - Risk: Inconsistent state between windows\n   - Mitigation: Event-driven updates, validation\n\n### 5.2 User Experience Risks\n\n1. **Confusion About Active Window**\n   - Risk: Users unsure which window is active\n   - Mitigation: Clear visual differentiation (color vs grayscale)\n\n2. **Window Positioning**\n   - Risk: Poor initial positioning on different screen configurations\n   - Mitigation: Smart positioning algorithm with fallbacks\n\n## 6. Testing Approach\n\n### 6.1 Unit Tests\n- DualWindowManager state transitions\n- WindowState serialization\n- Resource allocation/deallocation\n\n### 6.2 Integration Tests\n- Cross-window drag operations\n- Window activation/deactivation\n- File system operation coordination\n\n### 6.3 Performance Tests\n- Window switching latency\n- Memory usage with dual windows\n- CPU usage during inactive states\n\n### 6.4 User Acceptance Tests\n- Cross-window file organization workflows\n- Multi-monitor usage patterns\n- Window toggle operations\n\n## 7. Success Metrics\n\n1. **Performance Metrics**\n   - Window switching < 100ms (measured)\n   - Inactive window memory < 10MB (measured)\n   - Zero data loss in cross-window operations (verified)\n\n2. **User Experience Metrics**\n   - Clear active window indication (user feedback)\n   - Seamless drag-drop between windows (user testing)\n   - Intuitive window toggling (user feedback)\n\n3. **Competitive Advantage**\n   - Feature parity with Everything + unique drag-drop capability\n   - Marketing differentiator documented and tested\n\n## 8. Recommendations\n\n1. **Priority**: Implement dual-window as a core Stage 1 feature given its USP status\n2. **Architecture**: Use simplified binary window management for resource efficiency\n3. **UI/UX**: Prioritize visual clarity for active/inactive states\n4. **Testing**: Allocate significant testing time for cross-window operations\n5. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation to reflect dual-window capability\n\n## 9. Timeline Summary\n\nNo extension to the 13-week timeline is required. The feature can be integrated by:\n- Absorbing 7 days of UI work into the 3-week Stage 7\n- Minor adjustments to Stages 8-10 (total 3.5 days across 5 weeks)\n- Parallel development where possible\n\n## 10. Advantages of Dual-Window Approach Over Multi-Window\n\n1. **Simplified Architecture**: \n   - Binary state management instead of tracking multiple window IDs\n   - No need for window limits or warnings about too many windows\n\n2. **Resource Efficiency**:\n   - Only need to manage resources for one inactive window at most\n   - Memory management becomes much simpler\n\n3. **Clearer User Experience**:\n   - Toggle button provides clear mental model (on/off)\n   - Predictable side-by-side layout with two panes\n   - Less cognitive load for users\n\n4. **Faster Implementation**:\n   - Fewer edge cases to handle and test\n   - Simpler coordination logic\n   - Lower QA testing burden\n\n5. **Better Performance**:\n   - Lower resource overhead with only two windows\n   - More predictable behavior under memory pressure\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe dual-window implementation strikes an optimal balance between functionality and complexity. It delivers the key USP of cross-window drag-and-drop while avoiding the complexities of a full multi-window system. This approach embodies the Land Rover philosophy by focusing on robustness, simplicity, and fitness for purpose.\n\nThe simplified architecture reduces development time, testing complexity, and potential edge cases while still satisfying 99% of user needs. The implementation can be completed within the existing timeline and will provide a solid foundation for future enhancements if they prove necessary.",

Based on an analysis of the current codebase (Stage 4.3), several key architectural changes and new components are required to support the dual-window functionality.\n\nThe project's USP (cross-window drag-and-drop) requires careful design of window state management, resource coordination, and UI considerations. This report provides a practical approach aligned with the Land Rover philosophy: simplicity, robustness, and fitness for purpose.\n\n## 1. Current Architecture Assessment\n\n### 1.1 Existing Structure\n\nThe current Panoptikon implementation is based on a single-window architecture with the following key components:\n\n- **Core Services**: Service container, event bus, lifecycle manager\n- **UI Layer**: Basic macOS application using PyObjC bindings \n- **File System Operations**: File search and management\n- **Data Management**: Search results and query handling\n\n### 1.2 Key Limitations for Dual-Window Support\n\n- **Window Management**: No concept of multiple windows or window state\n- **Resource Coordination**: Resources not designed to be shared across windows\n- **UI Implementation**: Single window assumption in UI layer\n- **Search Context**: Search state tied to main application, not window-specific\n\n## 2.

Implementation Strategy\n\n### 4.1 Development Phases\n\n1. **Phase 1: Window Management Core**\n   - Implement DualWindowManager and WindowState classes\n   - Add window-related events\n   - Register services in container\n\n2. **Phase 2: UI Adaptation**\n   - Refactor FileSearchApp to support main and secondary windows\n   - Implement window styling for active/inactive states\n   - Add window toggle button and shortcut (Cmd+N)\n\n3. **Phase 3: Resource Management**\n   - Modify services to be window-aware\n   - Implement resource allocation/deallocation for window activation/deactivation\n   - Add state caching for inactive window\n\n4. **Phase 4: Drag and Drop Support**\n   - Implement cross-window drag detection\n   - Add drop target handling\n   - Implement operation coordination between windows\n\n5. **Phase 5: Polish**\n   - Implement window positioning algorithm\n   - Add visual indicators for active/inactive states\n   - Improve keyboard shortcuts\n   - Implement memory optimizations\n\n### 4.2 Key Implementation Details\n\n#### Window Delegate\n\n```python\nclass _WindowDelegate:\n    \"\"\"NSWindowDelegate implementation for tracking window activation.\"\"\"\n    \n    def init(self):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the delegate.\"\"\"\n        self = super().init()\n        if self:\n            self.callback = None\n            self.is_main = True\n        return self\n        \n    def setCallback_(self, callback):\n        \"\"\"Set the callback object.\"\"\"\n        self.callback = callback\n        \n    def setIsMain_(self, is_main):\n        \"\"\"Set whether this is the main window.\"\"\"\n        self.is_main = is_main\n        \n    def windowDidBecomeKey_(self, notification):\n        \"\"\"Called when the window becomes key (activated).\"\"\"\n        if self.callback:\n            self.callback.on_window_activated(self.is_main)\n```\n\n#### Drag and Drop Coordination\n\n```python\ndef _setup_drag_drop(self, table_view, is_main: bool) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Set up drag and drop for a table view.\"\"\"\n    # Register for drag operations\n    table_view.registerForDraggedTypes_([\"NSFilenamesPboardType\"])\n    \n    # Create drag source/destination handlers\n    table_drag_source = _TableDragSource.alloc().init()\n    table_drag_source.setCallback_(self)\n    table_drag_source.setIsMain_(is_main)\n    \n    table_drag_dest = _TableDragDestination.alloc().init()\n    table_drag_dest.setCallback_(self)\n    table_drag_dest.setIsMain_(is_main)\n    \n    # Set delegates\n    table_view.setDraggingSource_(table_drag_source)\n    table_view.setDraggingDestination_(table_drag_dest)\n```\n\n```python\ndef handle_drag_start(self, is_main: bool, files: list[str]) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Handle drag start from a window.\"\"\"\n    # Activate the source window\n    if is_main:\n        self._window_manager.activate_main_window()\n    else:\n        self._window_manager.activate_secondary_window()\n        \n    # Store drag source info for drop handling\n    self._drag_source_is_main = is_main\n    self._dragged_files = files\n    \ndef handle_drop(self, is_main: bool) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Handle drop in a window.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure we have a valid drag operation\n    if not hasattr(self, \"_drag_source_is_main\") or not hasattr(self, \"_dragged_files\"):\n        return False\n        \n    # Don't allow dropping in same window\n    if self._drag_source_is_main == is_main:\n        return False\n        \n    # Coordinate the operation\n    self._window_manager.coordinate_drag_operation(\n        is_from_main_window=self._drag_source_is_main,\n        files=self._dragged_files\n    )\n    \n    # Clear drag state\n    del self._drag_source_is_main\n    del self._dragged_files\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n## 5. Visual Styling for Active/Inactive Windows\n\nAs specified in the requirements, inactive windows should have a monochrome/grayscale appearance to visually distinguish them from the active window.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n```python\ndef _apply_window_styling(self, window, is_active: bool) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Apply styling based on window active state.\"\"\"\n    if not window:\n        return\n        \n    import AppKit\n    \n    content_view = window.contentView()\n    \n    if is_active:\n        # Full color for active window\n        self._apply_active_styling(content_view)\n    else:\n        # Grayscale for inactive window\n        self._apply_inactive_styling(content_view)\n        \ndef _apply_active_styling(self, view) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Apply active styling (full color) to a view hierarchy.\"\"\"\n    # In a real implementation, this would restore normal colors\n    # For all UI components in the view hierarchy\n    pass\n    \ndef _apply_inactive_styling(self, view) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Apply inactive styling (grayscale) to a view hierarchy.\"\"\"\n    # In a real implementation, this would apply a grayscale filter\n    # or desaturate all UI components in the view hierarchy\n    pass\n```\n\n## 6. Potential Issues and Mitigation\n\n### 6.1 Performance Concerns\n\n**Issue**: Secondary window might cause excessive memory/CPU usage  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Implement strict resource management for inactive window\n- Cache search results but limit cached size\n- Implement memory pressure detection and cleanup\n\n### 6.2 State Synchronization\n\n**Issue**: File system changes while window inactive  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Mark inactive window as \"stale\"\n- Add quick refresh on reactivation\n- Provide visual indicator for outdated results\n- Synchronize essential changes across both windows\n\n### 6.3 User Experience\n\n**Issue**: Unclear which window is active  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Implement distinct visual styling (color vs grayscale)\n- Ensure immediate visual feedback on window activation\n- Use macOS standard window activation behaviors\n\n### 6.4 Drag and Drop Reliability\n\n**Issue**: Coordination between windows might cause failures  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Implement robust transaction tracking\n- Add operation logging for diagnostics\n- Include error recovery mechanisms\n- Test extensively with large file sets\n\n## 7. Testing Strategy\n\n### 7.1 Unit Tests\n\n- DualWindowManager state changes\n- Window toggle functionality\n- Resource allocation and deallocation\n- Event publishing and subscription\n\n### 7.2 Integration Tests\n\n- Window activation/deactivation sequence\n- Cross-window drag and drop operations\n- Resource management during window switching\n- Multi-monitor testing\n\n### 7.3 Performance Tests\n\n- Memory usage with dual windows\n- Resource utilization during window switching\n- Drag and drop operation timing\n- Search performance across both windows\n\n## 8. Recommendations\n\n1. **Implement in Stages**: Follow the 5-phase approach outlined in section 4.1\n2. **Prioritize Core Architecture**: Start with DualWindowManager and WindowState\n3. **Focus on USP**: Ensure drag-and-drop reliability as highest priority\n4. **Defer Polish**: Leave visual refinements until core functionality works\n5. **Monitor Resources**: Add diagnostics for window-related memory usage\n6. **Visual Differentiation**: Implement the specified color vs grayscale approach\n7. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation as code changes\n\n## 9. Success Metrics\n\n1. **Performance**: Window switching < 100ms\n2. **Memory**: Inactive window uses < 10MB cached state\n3. **Reliability**: Zero data loss during cross-window operations\n4. **Usability**: Clear active window indication\n5. **USP Delivery**: Seamless drag-drop between windows\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe dual-window implementation requires targeted refactoring of the current Panoptikon codebase but can be accomplished efficiently within stage 4.3. By focusing on the Land Rover philosophy of simplicity, robustness, and fitness for purpose, the development team can deliver this key USP with minimal complexity.\n\nThe simplification from a multi-window system to a dual-window approach reduces development time, testing complexity, and potential edge cases while still delivering the core functionality. This approach strikes an optimal balance between feature richness and implementation practicality.",

Window State Management\n\n```\nWindowState {\n  - isMain: Boolean\n  - isActive: Boolean\n  - searchQuery: String  // Always visible in search field\n  - activeTab: TabIdentifier\n  - selectedFiles: Array<FileReference>\n  - scrollPosition: CGPoint\n  - columnConfiguration: ColumnSettings\n  - filterState: FilterConfiguration\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Strategy**:\n- Maintain WindowState objects for main and secondary windows\n- Persist search query in UI to maintain context\n- Use NSWindowController pattern for window lifecycle\n- Default positioning for secondary window beside main\n\n### 2. Active Window Coordination\n\n```\nDualWindowManager (Singleton) {\n  - activeWindow: \"main\" | \"secondary\"\n  - mainWindowState: WindowState\n  - secondaryWindowState: Optional<WindowState>\n  - activateMainWindow()\n  - activateSecondaryWindow()\n  - toggleSecondaryWindow()\n  - coordinateDragOperation(isFromMainWindow: Boolean, files: Array<FileReference>)\n}\n```\n\n**Activation Triggers**:\n- User clicks in window\n- Drag operation initiated from window\n- Window brought to foreground\n\n### 3. Resource Management Strategy\n\n**When Window Becomes Active**:\n- Resume file system monitoring\n- Refresh search results if needed\n- Restore scroll position and selection\n\n**When Window Becomes Inactive**:\n- Pause file system event processing\n- Cache current result set\n- Suspend background operations\n- Maintain UI responsiveness for drop targets\n\n### 4. Drag-and-Drop Coordination\n\n**Cross-Window Operations**:\n1. Drag initiated from inactive window \u2192 activate source window\n2. Track source window (main or secondary) in drag session\n3. Drop in target window \u2192 process through active window's services\n4. Log transaction with source and target window context\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Potential Issues & Mitigation\n\n### 1. State Synchronization\n**Issue**: File system changes while window inactive  \n**Mitigation**: \n- Mark inactive window as \"stale\"\n- Quick refresh on reactivation\n- Visual indicator for outdated results\n\n### 2. Resource Contention\n**Issue**: Two windows competing for file handles/locks  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Centralized file operation queue\n- Read operations can be concurrent\n- Write operations serialize through active window\n\n### 3. User Confusion\n**Issue**: Which window is active may be unclear  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Active window displays with full color styling\n- Inactive window shifts to monochrome/grayscale appearance\n- Instant visual feedback on window activation\n- No additional UI elements needed - the color state is the indicator\n\n### 4. Memory Usage\n**Issue**: Large result sets cached in inactive window  \n**Mitigation**:\n- Implement result set size limits\n- Lazy loading for cached results\n- Periodic memory pressure cleanup\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 UI/UX Considerations\n\n### Visual Design\n- **Window Chrome**: Standard macOS window controls (close/minimize/maximize)\n- **Distinct from Finder**: Custom appearance to create visual distance\n- **Search Field**: Always displays current query for context\n- **No Effects**: Simple window appearance without animations\n- **Active/Inactive States**: \n  - Active window: Full color interface\n  - Inactive window: Monochrome/grayscale appearance\n  - Immediate visual transition on focus change\n\n### Window Positioning\n- **Initial Layout**: Second window appears beside main (dual-pane style)\n- **Smart Positioning**: \n  - If screen space permits: side-by-side\n  - If not: cascade with offset\n  - Multi-monitor aware\n- **User Control**: Full freedom to reposition after creation\n\n### Keyboard Support\n- **Window Toggle**: Cmd+N (standard macOS convention)\n- **Window Switching**: Cmd+` (standard macOS window cycling)\n- **Search Focus**: Cmd+F or auto-focus on type\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Implementation Stages\n\n### Stage 1: Basic Dual-Window\n- Window creation via button and Cmd+N\n- Side-by-side positioning logic\n- Independent search states\n- Basic active/inactive management\n\n### Stage 2: Drag-Drop Support\n- Cross-window drag coordination\n- Transaction tracking\n- Drop target highlighting\n- Multi-monitor awareness\n\n### Stage 3: Resource Optimization\n- Smart state caching\n- Background operation suspension\n- Memory management\n- Performance monitoring\n\n### Stage 4: Polish\n- Visual state indicators\n- Refined positioning algorithm\n- Window focus management\n- Performance optimizations\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 Success Criteria\n\n1. **Performance**: Window switching < 100ms\n2. **Memory**: Inactive window uses < 10MB cached state\n3. **Reliability**: Zero data loss during cross-window operations\n4. **Usability**: Clear active window indication\n5. **USP Delivery**: Seamless drag-drop between windows (not available in Everything)\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Alternative Approaches Considered\n\n### Rejected: Multi-Window System (>2 windows)\n- **Why**: Unnecessary complexity for limited benefit\n- **Why**: Higher resource overhead\n- **Why**: More edge cases to handle\n\n### Rejected: Single Window with Tabs\n- **Why**: Doesn't support drag between contexts\n- **Why**: Less flexible workflow\n\n### Rejected: Process-per-Window\n- **Why**: IPC overhead\n- **Why**: Complex state sharing\n- **Why**: Higher memory footprint\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Open Questions\n\n1. **Window Positioning Algorithm**: Exact offset for cascade when side-by-side isn't possible?\n2. **Visual Distinction**: Specific design elements to differentiate from Finder?\n3. **Active Window Indicator**: Title bar highlight, border, or other method?\n4. **Multi-Monitor Behavior**: Which screen gets secondary window by default?",

    "text": "# Stage 4.2 to 4.3 Transition: Recommendations and Required Actions\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document outlines recommendations and required actions to complete before proceeding from Stage 4.2 (Connection Pool Management) to Stage 4.3 (Migration) in the Panoptikon project. The goal is to ensure technical debt is addressed, code quality and documentation meet project standards, and the codebase is ready for the next stage.\n\n## 1. Pydantic Validator Migration\n\n- **Current State:**\n  - The project uses Pydantic version 2 (as specified in `pyproject.toml`).\n  - Several configuration models (e.g., `DatabaseConfig` in `src/panoptikon/database/config.py`) still use Pydantic v1-style `@validator` decorators, which are deprecated in v2.\n- **Action Required:**\n  - Refactor all Pydantic validators to use the v2 `@field_validator` and `@model_validator` APIs.\n  - Remove any deprecated usage to ensure future compatibility and eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n## 2. Code Quality and Documentation\n\n- **Thread-Safety Documentation:**\n  - Add or improve docstrings for all public classes and methods in the connection pool code, explicitly stating thread-safety guarantees and limitations.\n- **Custom Exception Hierarchy:**\n  - Ensure all pool-related errors use a custom exception hierarchy (e.g., `ConnectionPoolError`, `ConnectionAcquisitionTimeout`) and are documented.\n- **Context Manager Usage:**\n  - Document all context manager usage (for transactions, connections, etc.) in public API docstrings.\n- **SQLite Single-Writer Limitation:**\n  - Document how the pool handles SQLite's single-writer limitation and what users should expect under write contention.\n- **Type Hints and Linting:**\n  - Ensure all public functions/classes have type hints and docstrings.\n  - Run Black, isort, and Ruff (with --fix) to ensure code style compliance.\n\n## 3. Testing and Performance\n\n- **Test Coverage:**\n  - While new code is well-covered, the overall project coverage is only 31%. Increase coverage, especially for modules interacting with the pool, to move toward the 80\u201395% target.\n- **Performance Profiling:**\n  - Run and document performance tests for connection acquisition under high concurrency (100+ threads), as required by the stage spec.\n- **Stress/Leak Testing:**\n  - Run stress tests to ensure there are no connection leaks or deadlocks under heavy load.\n\n## 4. Documentation and Migration Readiness\n\n- **Developer Documentation:**\n  - Update developer docs and README to reflect the new pool system, configuration options, and usage patterns.\n- **API Reference:**\n  - Generate or update API reference docs for all new/changed public classes and functions.\n- **Migration Plan:**\n  - Prepare a migration plan for Stage 4.3, including any schema changes, data migration scripts, and rollback strategies.\n- **Backward Compatibility:**\n  - Ensure the new pool system is backward compatible with existing database files and configurations.\n\n## 5. Summary Table\n\n| Area                | Recommendation/Action                                             |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Validators          | Migrate to Pydantic v2 APIs                                       |\n| Thread Safety       | Document guarantees/limitations                                   |\n| Exceptions          | Use and document custom exception hierarchy                       |\n| Context Managers    | Document usage in API docstrings                                  |\n| SQLite Limitation   | Document single-writer handling                                   |\n| Test Coverage       | Increase overall project coverage                                 |\n| Performance         | Profile connection acquisition under load                         |\n| Stress Testing      | Run leak/deadlock tests                                           |\n| Documentation       | Update developer/API docs                                         |\n| Code Standards      | Ensure type hints, docstrings, linting, formatting                |\n| Migration Plan      | Prepare for schema/data migration, ensure backward compatibility   |\n\n## 6. Next Steps\n\n- Review and discuss these recommendations with the team.\n- Assign action items and owners for each area.\n- Complete all required actions before starting Stage 4.3 (Migration).",

    "text": "# Panoptikon System Architecture - Pragmatic Approach\n\n## 1. System Overview\n\nPanoptikon is a high-performance macOS file search utility designed to provide instant filename search across all storage locations with zero configuration. The system focuses exclusively on ultra-fast filename search in its initial stage, with a clean architecture that balances immediate development needs with strategic resilience against the most critical aspects of macOS evolution.\n\n### 1.1 Core Value Proposition\n\nPanoptikon's core promise is simple: \"It knows where everything is with no blindspots.\" The application delivers:\n- Ultra-fast filename search (sub-50ms response time)\n- Complete visibility across local, network, and cloud storage\n- Zero configuration for cloud services\n- Dual-paradigm interface supporting both keyboard and mouse workflows\n- Minimal resource footprint\n\n### 1.2 Target Performance Metrics\n\n- **Launch time**: Under 100ms from hotkey to focused search field\n- **Search latency**: Under 50ms from keystroke to displayed results\n- **UI responsiveness**: 60fps animation and rendering (16ms per frame)\n- **Indexing speed**: 250,000 files in under 60 seconds\n- **Memory footprint**: Below 50MB when idle\n- **CPU usage**: Negligible when idle\n- **Installed size**: Application bundle under 30MB\n\n### 1.3 OS Evolution Protection Strategy\n\nRather than attempting to bulletproof every aspect of the system, this architecture focuses on protecting the most volatile and critical OS touchpoints:\n\n- **Targeted Abstraction**: Create strong abstraction only for historically volatile OS interfaces\n- **Focused Capability Detection**: Implement feature detection for essential capabilities with known variation\n- **Strategic Adaptation**: Provide adaptation mechanisms for high-risk subsystems\n- **Standard Approaches**: Use conventional design for stable components\n\n## 2.

this pragmatic architecture, we adopt a standard layered approach but include **key abstraction points** for the most volatile OS interfaces:\n\n1. **FSEvents Wrapper**: Isolated to handle file system monitoring changes\n2. **FS Operations**: Abstracted to manage permissions and cloud storage evolution\n3. **UI Components**: Carefully designed to accommodate UI framework changes\n\n### 2.2 Core Components\n\n#### 2.2.1 UI Layer\n\n- **Search Field**: NSSearchField for user input with as-you-type filtering\n- **Tab Bar**: NSSegmentedControl for category filtering\n- **Results Table**: NSTableView with virtual rendering for performance\n- **Context Menus**: Right-click operations for Windows-familiar workflow\n- **Progress Overlay**: Non-intrusive indexing status visualization\n- **Preference Panel**: Configuration interface for path rules and settings\n\n#### 2.2.2 Core Services Layer\n\n- **Search Engine**: Query parsing and execution with wildcard support\n- **Input Controller**: Transforms user input into queries and commands\n- **Results Model**: Data structure for filtered and sorted results\n- **Query Parser**: Interprets search patterns and optimizes execution\n- **Service Container**: Dependency injection system for components\n- **Result Sorter**: Optimized ordering of result sets\n- **Path Resolver**: Rule evaluation for inclusion/exclusion logic\n- **Event Bus**: Decoupled messaging between components\n- **Cloud Manager**: Provider detection and delegation\n\n#### 2.2.3 Data Layer\n\n- **Indexer**: Background process for building file database\n- **Database Access**: Interface for storage operations\n- **File Monitor**: Detects file system changes with adaptation capabilities\n- **Metadata Extractor**: Pulls essential file attributes\n- **SQLite Database**: Primary storage for file metadata\n- **FSEvents Wrapper**: Isolated integration with file notifications\n- **Radix Cache**: In-memory structure for rapid path matching\n- **Connection Pool**: Thread-safe database access\n- **FS Operations**: File system interaction with permission awareness\n\n### 2.3 Data Flow Architecture\n\n#### 2.3.1 Primary Search Flow\n\n1. User enters search text in Search Field\n2. Input Controller transforms input to search query\n3. Search Engine executes query against Database and Radix Cache\n4. Results Model collects and organizes matching files\n5. Results Table displays virtual view of results\n6. UI updates in under 50ms for instantaneous feel\n\n#### 2.3.2 Indexing Flow\n\n1. File Monitor receives file system notifications through FSEvents Wrapper\n2. Path Resolver evaluates path against inclusion/exclusion rules\n3. Indexer extracts metadata from qualifying files\n4. Database Access stores information in SQLite\n5. Progress Overlay provides non-intrusive status updates\n6. Radix Cache updates in-memory representation\n\n#### 2.3.3 File Operation Flow with Provider Awareness\n\n1. User selects file(s) in Results Table\n2. Context Menu or keyboard shortcut initiates operation\n3. Cloud Manager determines file location type\n4. FS Operations delegates to system handlers:\n   - For cloud files: Uses NSWorkspace.shared.open() or equivalent\n   - For local files: Direct file system operations\n   - Never directly handles cloud sync/download - always delegates to Finder\n5. UI provides feedback on operation outcome\n\n## 3.

    "text": "# Stage 4.2: Connection Pool Management - Implementation Report\n\n## Overview\n\nThis report documents the implementation of Stage 4.2 (Connection Pool Management) of the Panoptikon project. This stage focused on implementing a robust, thread-safe connection pool system for SQLite database connections with health monitoring, automatic reconnection, and transaction isolation level support.\n\n## Completed Components\n\n### 1. Connection Pool Implementation (`src/panoptikon/database/pool.py`)\n\nThe core connection pool functionality was implemented with the following features:\n\n- **Thread-safe connection pool** that can be accessed from multiple threads concurrently\n- **Connection health monitoring** to detect and replace unhealthy connections\n- **Automatic connection recycling** based on age and health status\n- **Configurable pool limits** for maximum and minimum connections\n- **Transaction isolation level support** (DEFERRED, IMMEDIATE, EXCLUSIVE)\n- **Savepoint support** for nested transactions\n\nKey classes implemented:\n- `ConnectionPool`: Manages a pool of SQLite connections for a specific database file\n- `PooledConnection`: Wrapper around a SQLite connection with metadata\n- `PoolManager`: Manages multiple connection pools for different database files\n- `TransactionIsolationLevel`: Enum for SQLite transaction isolation levels\n- `ConnectionHealthStatus`: Enum for connection health states\n\n### 2. Database Pool Service (`src/panoptikon/database/pool_service.py`)\n\nA service layer was implemented to integrate the connection pool with the application's service container architecture:\n\n- **Service integration** with the application's service container\n- **Schema management** with validation and automatic creation\n- **Configuration integration** with the core config system\n- **High-level API** for database operations\n- **Proper lifecycle management** (initialization, shutdown)\n\n### 3. Configuration Integration (`src/panoptikon/database/config.py`)\n\nThe database configuration was updated to include connection pool settings:\n\n- Added `max_connections`, `min_connections`, `connection_max_age`, and `health_check_interval` parameters\n- Implemented validators for all pool configuration parameters\n- Maintained backward compatibility with existing configurations\n\n### 4. Module Integration (`src/panoptikon/database/__init__.py`)\n\nThe database module's `__init__.py` was updated to expose all new types and functions, ensuring they are available to the rest of the application.\n\n## Testing\n\nComprehensive tests were implemented for both the connection pool and pool service:\n\n- 17 tests for the connection pool implementation\n- 11 tests for the pool service implementation\n- All 28 tests passing successfully\n\nTest coverage:\n- `pool.py`: 76% coverage\n- `pool_service.py`: 87% coverage\n\nTest categories include:\n- Basic connection pool operations\n- Connection reuse and recycling\n- Connection health monitoring\n- Transaction and savepoint functionality\n- Thread safety and concurrent access\n- Service initialization and shutdown\n- Configuration integration\n- Error handling\n\n## Future Considerations\n\n1. **Pydantic Migration**: The current implementation uses Pydantic V1 style validators which are deprecated. Future work should migrate to Pydantic V2 style field validators.\n\n2. **Coverage Improvement**: While the new code has good test coverage, the overall project coverage is at 31%, below the required 80%. Future work should include improving test coverage across the entire project.\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**: The connection pool could be further optimized for high-throughput scenarios, including potential improvements to the connection acquisition algorithm.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStage 4.2 has been successfully completed with all requirements implemented and tested. The connection pool management system provides robust database connection handling for the application, ensuring efficient use of resources, improved thread safety, and better transaction management.\n\nThe implementation serves as a solid foundation for the next stages of database development in the Panoptikon project.",

and a space, sentence case, period at end\n- **Trailing Commas**: Use trailing commas in multi-line collections\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- **Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions, not bare except\n- **Error Messages**: Provide clear error messages\n- **Logging**: Use the logging module instead of print statements\n- **Context Managers**: Use context managers for resource management\n- **Error Propagation**: Raise exceptions at the appropriate level\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Path Handling**: Use pathlib instead of os.path\n- **File I/O**: Use context managers for file operations\n- **Dependencies**: Avoid circular dependencies\n- **Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance\n- **Immutability**: Use immutable data structures when appropriate\n- **Constants**: Define constants at the module level\n- **Default Arguments**: Avoid mutable default arguments\n\n## Testing Standards\n\n- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage\n- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for all functionality\n- **Test Isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other\n- **Test Performance**: Tests should run quickly\n- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names\n- **Assertions**: Use appropriate assertions\n- **Fixtures**: Use fixtures for test setup\n- **Mocking**: Use mocking for external dependencies\n\n## Package Structure\n\n```\nsrc/panoptikon/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py            # Package initialization\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index/                 # File indexing system\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 db/                    # Database operations\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 search/                # Search functionality\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cloud/                 # Cloud provider integration\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ui/                    # PyObjC interface\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config/                # Application settings\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/                 # Common utilities\n```\n\n## Commit Standards\n\n- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change\n- **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages\n- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: All commits must pass pre-commit hooks\n- **Branch Strategy**: Use feature branches for development\n\n## Quality Enforcement\n\n- **Linting**: All code must pass flake8, pylint, and ruff checks\n- **Type Checking**: All code must pass mypy type checking\n- **Formatting**: All code must be formatted with Black\n- **Pre-Commit**: Use pre-commit hooks to enforce standards\n- **CI/CD**: Automated quality checks in CI/CD pipeline",

    "text": "# PyObjC Typing Solution for Panoptikon\n\nThis document explains the \"boundary pattern\" solution we've implemented to address the type checking issues with PyObjC in our macOS application.\n\n## The Problem\n\nPyObjC stubs are incompatible with our Python version, leaving PyObjC code without proper type checking. This prevents us from maintaining a strictly typed codebase while using PyObjC for macOS native UI components.\n\n## The Solution: Boundary Pattern\n\nWe've implemented a \"boundary pattern\" that:\n\n1. Creates a clear separation between typed Python code and untyped PyObjC code\n2. Contains `# type: ignore` comments only within the boundary classes\n3. Provides properly typed interfaces for the rest of the application\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Wrapper Classes (`src/panoptikon/ui/objc_wrappers.py`)\n\nThese classes:\n- Wrap PyObjC interfaces with proper Python type annotations\n- Isolate all `# type: ignore` comments\n- Provide a clean, typed API for the rest of the application\n\nExample for NSSearchField:\n\n```python\nclass SearchFieldWrapper:\n    \"\"\"Typed wrapper for NSSearchField.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, frame: Optional[Rect] = None) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Initialize with an optional frame rectangle.\"\"\"\n        if frame is not None:\n            self._search_field = AppKit.NSSearchField.alloc().initWithFrame_(\n                Foundation.NSMakeRect(*frame)\n            )\n        else:\n            self._search_field = AppKit.NSSearchField.alloc().init()\n\n    def set_placeholder(self, text: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Set the placeholder text.\"\"\"\n        cell = self._search_field.cell()\n        cell.setPlaceholderString_(text)\n\n    @property\n    def ns_object(self) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"Get the underlying NSSearchField object.\"\"\"\n        return self._search_field\n```\n\n### 2. Custom Type Stubs (`src/panoptikon/typings/`)\n\nWe've created minimal type stubs (.pyi files) for critical PyObjC components:\n- AppKit (NSSearchField, NSTableView, NSSegmentedControl)\n- Foundation\n- objc\n\nThese stubs define just enough types to support our application without requiring full PyObjC typing support.\n\n### 3. MyPy Configuration\n\nThe `pyproject.toml` has been updated with:\n\n```toml\n[tool.mypy]\n# Existing config...\nmypy_path = [\"src/panoptikon/typings\"]\nwarn_unused_ignores = false  # Changed because we need to use # type: ignore for PyObjC\n\n# Ignore PyObjC related imports in type checking\n[[tool.mypy.overrides]]\nmodule = \"objc\"\nignore_missing_imports = true\n\n[[tool.mypy.overrides]]\nmodule = \"Foundation\"\nignore_missing_imports = true\n\n[[tool.mypy.overrides]]\nmodule = \"AppKit\"\nignore_missing_imports = true\n\n[[tool.mypy.overrides]]\nmodule = \"Cocoa\"\nignore_missing_imports = true\n```\n\n### 4. Runtime Validation (`src/panoptikon/ui/validators.py`)\n\nWe've created runtime validators that:\n- Verify PyObjC method existence\n- Validate protocol implementation\n- Provide decorator for validating PyObjC calls at runtime\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef validate_table_data_source(obj: Any) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Validate that an object can serve as an NSTableViewDataSource.\"\"\"\n    required_methods = [\n        \"numberOfRowsInTableView_\",\n        \"tableView_objectValueForTableColumn_row_\",\n    ]\n    return validate_objc_protocol_conformance(obj, required_methods)\n```\n\n### 5. Integration Tests (`tests/ui/test_objc_integration.py`)\n\nTests that verify:\n- Wrappers correctly interact with PyObjC\n- Runtime validations catch interface errors early\n- PyObjC functionality works as expected\n\nThe tests are skipped if PyObjC is not available, allowing testing on systems without PyObjC.\n\n## Usage Example (`src/panoptikon/ui/macos_app.py`)\n\nThe `FileSearchApp` class demonstrates:\n- Using the wrapper classes for PyObjC components\n- Runtime validation of delegate implementations\n- Proper typing for the application logic\n- Isolating PyObjC imports within limited scope\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Type Safety**: The codebase maintains strict typing for all Python code\n2. **Isolation**: PyObjC code is clearly separated and contained\n3. **Early Error Detection**: Runtime validation catches interface errors early\n4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make the code easier to understand and maintain\n5. **Testability**: The solution allows for testing PyObjC code in controlled environments\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis solution provides a robust approach to using PyObjC in a strictly typed Python application. By creating a clear boundary between typed Python code and untyped PyObjC code, we can maintain type safety throughout the codebase while still leveraging the power of PyObjC for macOS native UI components.",
