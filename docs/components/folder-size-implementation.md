# Folder Size Implementation

## Overview
The folder size feature enables Panoptikon to display and sort by the total size of directories, providing instant visibility into space usage. This is a unique selling point compared to other file explorers.

## Status
- **Database Migration:** Completed in schema version 1.1.0 (Phase 4.3)
- **Indexing Calculation:** Pending (Phase 6)
- **UI Display/Sorting:** Pending (Phase 7)

## Database Migration (Schema 1.1.0)
- Added `folder_size INTEGER` column to the `files` table (for directories only).
- Created index `idx_files_folder_size` for efficient sorting.
- Migration is idempotent, safe, and fully tested.
- Lays groundwork for recursive folder size calculation in later stages.

## Indexing Phase (Pending)
- Implement recursive folder size calculation for all indexed directories.
- Store calculated folder sizes in the `folder_size` column.
- Update folder sizes incrementally as files are added, removed, or changed.
- Handle symlinks, hard links, and permission errors robustly.
- Add tests for accuracy and performance.

## UI Changes (Pending)
- Add a "Folder Size" column to the results table, visible for directories.
- Format folder sizes in human-readable units (KB/MB/GB).
- Enable sorting by folder size in the UI.

## Rationale
- Folder size is a major differentiator and user-requested feature.
- Enables users to quickly identify space usage and large directories.
- Supports instant sorting and filtering by size.
