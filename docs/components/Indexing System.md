# Indexing System

## [2025-05-24 01:53] Stage 6.1a: Enhanced State Management Integration

### Overview
The indexing system now features robust, production-ready state management:
- **Operation IDs**: Every indexing operation (initial, incremental, recovery) is tracked with a unique operation ID (UUID).
- **Structured Checkpoints**: Progress is saved in structured checkpoints, including files processed, current path, errors, and rate.
- **Pause/Resume**: Indexing can be paused and resumed, with full recovery from the last checkpoint.
- **Throttled Checkpointing**: Checkpoints are written at a configurable interval (default: 1s) to avoid excessive DB writes.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are logged, operation state is updated to 'failed', and error events are published.
- **Automatic Recovery**: Interrupted or paused operations are detected on startup and can be resumed.

### Key Features
- **Single-row state table**: Only one active operation is tracked at a time (future migration will support history).
- **Operation status**: Status can be 'idle', 'in_progress', 'paused', 'completed', or 'failed'.
- **Progress reporting**: Status includes files processed, total files, rate, errors, and duration.
- **Integration**: The new state manager is fully integrated with `IndexerService` and all core indexing flows.

### Migration Notes
- No database migration is required; the schema is backward compatible.
- The API for starting, pausing, and resuming indexing is unchanged, but status and error reporting are more detailed.
- Any code that previously accessed the old state manager should use the new `IndexingStateManager` in `panoptikon.indexing.state_manager`.

### Operational Guidance
- **Monitoring**: Operation IDs are logged for all major events (start, pause, resume, complete, fail).
- **Metrics**: Average indexing rate, checkpoint frequency, and resume success are logged for monitoring.
- **Edge Cases**: For very large directories, checkpointing is efficient but may add minor overhead. Rapid pause/resume and disk space exhaustion are handled gracefully, but should be monitored in production.

### Future Enhancements
- Operation history (multi-row design)
- Configurable checkpoint intervals
- Progress estimation based on historical rates
- Automatic resume on application start
