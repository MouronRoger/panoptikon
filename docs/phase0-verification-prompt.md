# Phase 0: Project Bootstrapping - Verification Prompt

I need you to verify the Phase 0 implementation of the Panoptikon project and prepare documentation for the transition to Phase 1.

## Verification Process

First, read the implementation documentation:

```
read_file docs/phase0_complete.md
```

Then, perform these verification steps in sequence:

## Step 1: Project Structure Verification

Verify that the project structure meets all requirements:

```
list_directory .
```

Check that all required directories exist and have proper structure:

```
list_directory src/panoptikon
list_directory tests
```

Validate that each module has the required files and structure, especially checking:
- All `__init__.py` files exist
- Module structure matches specifications
- Documentation files are present

## Step 2: Quality Tool Verification

Validate that all quality tools are properly configured:

1. Check tool configurations:
   ```
   read_file pyproject.toml
   read_file .pre-commit-config.yaml
   ```

2. Verify pre-commit hooks installation:
   ```
   pre-commit --version
   ```

3. Run a test formatting check:
   ```
   black --check src
   ```

4. Run a test linting check:
   ```
   ruff check src
   ```

5. Run a test type check:
   ```
   mypy src
   ```

## Step 3: Test Framework Verification

Test that the testing infrastructure works correctly:

1. Check test directory structure:
   ```
   list_directory tests
   ```

2. Run a basic test to verify pytest configuration:
   ```
   pytest -xvs
   ```

3. Verify coverage configuration:
   ```
   pytest --cov=src/panoptikon tests/
   ```

## Step 4: Documentation Review

Review all documentation for completeness and correctness:

1. Check main project documentation:
   ```
   read_file README.md
   read_file CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

2. Review project status documentation:
   ```
   read_file docs/project_status.md
   ```

## Step 5: Create Verification Report

Create a comprehensive verification report at `docs/phase0_verification.md` that includes:

1. Results of all verification steps
2. Project structure assessment
3. Quality tool configuration status
4. Test framework functionality
5. Documentation completeness
6. Any issues or discrepancies found
7. Recommendations for improvements or adjustments
8. Clear confirmation that Phase 0 is complete or list of remaining tasks

## Step 6: Prepare Phase 1 Status Document

Create a Phase 1 status document at `docs/phase1_status.md` that includes:

1. Current Phase (Phase 1: MVP Implementation)
2. Component list to be implemented:
   - File indexing system
   - Database schema and operations
   - Basic search functionality
   - Terminal interface
3. Required features from the specification
4. Implementation guidelines for Phase 1
5. Quality expectations for the implementation

## Deliverables

The verification process must produce these deliverables:

1. `docs/phase0_verification.md` - Comprehensive verification report
2. `docs/phase1_status.md` - Status document for Phase 1

These documents are CRITICAL for continuity as they will be used by the next instance of Claude to implement Phase 1.

## Critical Verification Criteria

Focus especially on verifying these critical aspects:

1. Quality tool configuration is complete and functional
2. Project structure follows the specification exactly
3. Test infrastructure works correctly
4. Documentation provides clear guidance for next steps
5. Type checking is properly configured
6. Docstring standards are clearly defined

If any of these critical criteria are not met, the verification should fail and specify exactly what needs to be fixed before proceeding to Phase 1.
