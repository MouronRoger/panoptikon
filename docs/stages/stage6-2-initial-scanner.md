# Stage 6.2: Initial Scanner Implementation

## Overview

The Initial Scanner is responsible for efficiently traversing the file system to populate the index with file metadata. This module must handle deep directory structures, respect inclusion/exclusion rules, and manage permissions while optimizing for performance.

## Objectives

- Implement high-performance recursive directory scanning
- Create path filtering based on inclusion/exclusion rules
- Build permission-aware scanning with appropriate fallbacks
- Optimize scanning through multi-threading and resource management

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Directory Traversal

- Implement recursive directory scanning:
  ```python
  def scan_directory(root_path, depth=0, max_depth=None):
      """Recursively scan directory and yield file paths."""
      try:
          for entry in os.scandir(root_path):
              yield entry.path
              
              if entry.is_dir() and (max_depth is None or depth < max_depth):
                  yield from scan_directory(entry.path, depth + 1, max_depth)
      except PermissionError:
          # Handle permission error and log
          pass
      except FileNotFoundError:
          # Handle missing directory and log
          pass
  ```

- Create path filtering integration:
  - Apply inclusion/exclusion rules during traversal
  - Skip excluded directories early to improve performance
  - Support pattern matching for file extensions

- Build queue management:
  - Implement depth-first or breadth-first traversal options
  - Create priority queue for important directories
  - Implement iterator-based yielding for memory efficiency

### 2. Permission Handling

- Implement permission-aware scanning:
  - Detect and log permission issues
  - Skip inaccessible directories with appropriate notification
  - Track permission state for future reference

- Create security-scoped bookmark integration:
  - Use bookmarks to maintain access to user-selected directories
  - Properly start/stop bookmark access scope
  - Handle bookmark invalidation

- Build permission diagnostics:
  - Create readable permission error messages
  - Suggest solutions for common permission issues
  - Implement permission verification utility

### 3. Scan Optimization

- Implement multi-threaded scanning:
  - Create thread pool for parallel directory traversal
  - Implement work stealing for balanced load
  - Maintain thread safety for database operations
  - Update checkpoint after each batch:
    ```python
    def scan_with_checkpointing(self, paths, state_manager, operation_id):
        """Scan directories with checkpoint updates."""
        files_processed = 0
        batch_size = 1000
        batch = []
        
        for path in self.scan_directory(paths):
            batch.append(path)
            
            if len(batch) >= batch_size:
                # Process batch
                self.process_batch(batch)
                files_processed += len(batch)
                
                # Update checkpoint
                state_manager.update_checkpoint(
                    operation_id,
                    files_processed=files_processed,
                    current_path=os.path.dirname(path),
                    last_file=path
                )
                
                batch = []
    ```

- Create scan prioritization:
  - Prioritize user directories over system locations
  - Process smaller directories before larger ones for quicker feedback
  - Prioritize directories with recent changes

- Build resource management:
  - Implement adaptive thread count based on system capabilities
  - Monitor and throttle scanning based on system load
  - Implement pause/resume capability for heavy operations

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test rule application with various path patterns
   - Verify correct handling of permission errors
   - Test directory traversal with mock file system

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test scanning with real directory structures
   - Verify correct handling of symbolic links and junctions
   - Test with various permission scenarios

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark scanning speed (files per second)
   - Measure memory usage during large directory scans
   - Compare single vs. multi-threaded performance
   - Test with 10k, 50k, and 250k files to verify scaling

## Success Criteria

- Directory scanning correctly traverses all accessible files
- Path rules correctly applied during traversal
- Permission issues handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- Multi-threaded scanning shows clear performance benefits
- Scanning performance exceeds 5,000 files per second on target hardware
- 95% test coverage achieved
- Resource usage remains within defined constraints

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: Core Indexing Framework (Stage 6.1), Path Rule System (Stage 5)
- **Required by**: Incremental Updates (Stage 6.4)

## Time Estimate

- Implementation: 3-4 days
- Testing: 1-2 days
