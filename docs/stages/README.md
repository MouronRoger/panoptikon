# Stages Directory

**Terminology:**
- “Stage” = One of the 4 high-level development units (matches this directory and tags)
- “Stage” = One of the 11 implementation units (formerly called “stages” in older docs)
- See the development roadmap for the mapping between stages and stages.

This naming is chosen to maintain consistency with existing documentation and memory systems.
