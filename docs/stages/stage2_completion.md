# 🏁 STAGE 2: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE - COMPLETION REPORT

## 📋 Overview
Stage 2 focused on developing the core infrastructure components of the Panoptikon application, including service container, event bus, configuration system, error handling, and application lifecycle management. All objectives have been successfully completed.

## ✅ Completed Requirements

### 1. Service Container
- ✓ Created `ServiceInterface` base class for injectable services
- ✓ Implemented container with registration and resolution:
  - Support for singleton and transient service lifetimes
  - Automatic constructor dependency injection
  - Factory method support for complex construction scenarios
- ✓ Added lifecycle hooks (initialize, shutdown)
- ✓ Implemented dependency graph validation to prevent circular references
- ✓ Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality

### 2. Event Bus
- ✓ Designed event types and payload structures:
  - `EventBase` base class with required metadata
  - Support for dataclass-based events
  - JSON serialization for logging and persistence
- ✓ Implemented subscription/publication mechanism:
  - Type-based event routing
  - Priority-based event delivery
  - Inherited event type handling
- ✓ Support for both synchronous and asynchronous event handling
- ✓ Added event logging and history for debugging

### 3. Configuration System
- ✓ Created settings hierarchy:
  - Default values defined in schema
  - User settings from config files
  - Runtime/temporary settings
- ✓ Implemented schema validation using Pydantic models
- ✓ Added hot reloading of configuration changes
- ✓ Support for secure handling of sensitive settings
- ✓ Event-based notification of configuration changes

### 4. Error Handling
- ✓ Created structured error types and categories:
  - Context-rich error objects
  - Categorized errors (database, filesystem, etc.)
  - Severity levels for appropriate handling
- ✓ Implemented error reporting through event system
- ✓ Added recovery mechanism for known error conditions
- ✓ Diagnostic information collection for troubleshooting
- ✓ Error history for post-mortem analysis

### 5. Application Lifecycle
- ✓ Implemented startup/shutdown sequence:
  - Orderly initialization and shutdown
  - Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
  - Clean exit handling
- ✓ Created service initialization ordering through priorities
- ✓ Added resource cleanup on exit
- ✓ Implemented application state monitoring
- ✓ Event-based state change notifications

## 🧪 Testing
- Unit tests implemented for the service container
- Manual verification of other components
- Additional tests to be added in subsequent stages

## 🔗 Integration
The components are designed to work together seamlessly:
- Services are registered in the container and automatically initialized
- Components communicate through the event bus
- Configuration changes trigger events
- Errors are reported through the event system
- Lifecycle manages the coordinated startup and shutdown

## 📝 Notes
- The components are designed to be platform-independent
- No UI-specific code has been introduced yet, as specified in the constraints
- The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Error handling is comprehensive and allows for graceful degradation

## 🚀 Next Steps
With the core infrastructure in place, the project is now ready to move to Stage 3, which will focus on implementing the search engine, file system integration, and indexing capabilities.

## 📦 Code Structure
The implemented components are organized in the `core` module:
```
src/panoptikon/core/
├── __init__.py
├── service.py     # Service container implementation
├── events.py      # Event bus implementation
├── config.py      # Configuration system
├── errors.py      # Error handling framework
└── lifecycle.py   # Application lifecycle management
```

## 🔍 Additional Details
- The service container performs dependency injection automatically by analyzing constructor parameter types
- The event bus supports both class-based and function-based event handlers
- The configuration system uses Pydantic for schema validation
- The error handling system integrates with the event bus for notifications
- The application lifecycle manages orderly startup and shutdown sequences
