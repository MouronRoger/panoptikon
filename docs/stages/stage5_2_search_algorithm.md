# 🔍 SEGMENT 5.2: SEARCH ALGORITHM

## 📋 CONTEXT
**Stage**: 5 - Search Engine
**Segment**: 5.2 - Search Algorithm
**Dependencies**: Query Parser (Segment 5.1), Database Foundation (Stage 4)

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES
Implement a high-performance search algorithm that executes parsed queries against the file database, delivering results in under 50ms even for large file sets, with optimized memory usage and caching.

## 📑 SPECIFICATIONS

### Core Requirements
- Execute parsed queries against database with optimal performance
- Support efficient index-based search
- Implement incremental result retrieval for large result sets
- Create optimized caching system for frequent searches
- Ensure memory-efficient operation across large file indexes

### Technical Implementation
1. Develop SearchEngine class with clean interfaces
2. Create specialized database query generators from parsed patterns
3. Implement query execution with prepared statements
4. Design cache invalidation based on indexing events
5. Build adaptive result fetching based on result size

### Performance Targets
- Search execution under 50ms for 10,000+ files
- Optimize for common search patterns
- Memory usage proportional to result set size, not index size

## 🧪 TEST REQUIREMENTS

### Unit Tests
- Test basic exact match searches
- Test wildcard searches with different patterns
- Test case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches
- Test extension filtering
- Test performance with large databases
- Test cache hit and miss scenarios
- Test concurrent search operations

### Integration Tests
- Test integration with query parser
- Test integration with database layer
- Measure search latency across different query types
- Verify memory usage during search operations

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Key Design Principles
- Use prepared statements for all database queries
- Implement LRU caching for frequent search patterns
- Apply partial result materialization for large result sets
- Clear separation between search logic and result management

### Interfaces
```python
# Key interface (not actual implementation)
class SearchEngine:
    def __init__(self, database_connection, cache_size=100):
        """
        Initialize search engine with database connection
        
        Args:
            database_connection: Connection to file database
            cache_size: Maximum number of cached query results
        """
        pass
    
    def search(self, query_pattern, limit=None, offset=None):
        """
        Execute a search using the provided query pattern
        
        Args:
            query_pattern: QueryPattern from QueryParser
            limit: Maximum number of results to return
            offset: Number of results to skip
            
        Returns:
            SearchResult object containing matching files
        """
        pass
        
    def invalidate_cache(self, path=None):
        """
        Invalidate cache entries
        
        Args:
            path: Optional path to invalidate (or all if None)
        """
        pass
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful handling of database connection issues
- Timeout mechanism for runaway queries
- Recovery strategy for partial results on error
