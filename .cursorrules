# Cursor AI Custom Rules - Panoptikon Project

**IMPORTANT:** The project uses a unified Qdrant cloud instance as the canonical knowledge base. All documentation is synced to collection `panoptikon` and accessed via MCP server integration.

## Core Rules

- Always reference the current phase and subphase from docs/spec/phases, as indexed in the Qdrant cloud instance.
- Track progress and next steps for the current phase in the documentation system.
- Use tags/flags (e.g., #decision, #todo, #done, #rationale, #milestone, #bug) for all major actions and decisions.
- Use docs/ai_docs.md as a session log:
  - At session start, read the latest phase and docs/ai_docs.md to set context.
  - At session end, append a summary of work, decisions, and next steps with tags.
  - Sync to Qdrant using the documentation system in scripts/ai_docs.py.
- Format all entries with timestamp, tags, and clear summaries.
- If phases are broken down further, always update the reference and breadcrumbs.
- If a new phase or subphase is started, log the transition in docs/ai_docs.md and sync to Qdrant.

## Documentation System

Use the unified documentation system in scripts/ai_docs.py which:
- Creates markdown files in appropriate categories
- Automatically indexes content in Qdrant collection `panoptikon`
- Provides semantic search capabilities
- Syncs with MCP server for project state

## Qdrant Integration

- **Collection**: `panoptikon` (NOT panoptikon_docs)
- **Scripts**: Located in scripts/qdrant/
- **Indexing**: Use `./scripts/qdrant/qdrant.sh index` for manual indexing
- **Search**: Use documentation system functions or `./scripts/qdrant/qdrant.sh search`

## Key Commands

```python
from scripts.ai_docs import *

# Search project state
results = search_documentation("current phase status")

# Update progress
update_phase_progress("Phase 4", status="In Progress", ...)

# Document decisions
record_decision("Title", status="Accepted", ...)
```

## Important Notes

- NEVER use local Qdrant instances - always use the cloud instance
- All documentation operations should go through scripts/ai_docs.py
- The MCP server provides semantic search via the Qdrant integration
- Check scripts/qdrant/README.md for manual operations if needed
