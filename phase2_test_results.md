# Phase 2 Core Infrastructure Testing Results

## Summary
We successfully tested the core infrastructure components implemented in Phase 2 of the Panoptikon project. The test verified that the essential components (service container and event bus) are working as expected.

## Components Tested
1. **Service Container**
   - Service registration
   - Dependency resolution
   - Service lifecycle management (initialization and shutdown)

2. **Event Bus**
   - Event publication
   - Event subscription
   - Event delivery

## Issues Found and Solutions

### Issue 1: Virtual Environment Problems
The project's virtual environment was corrupted, causing issues with dependency installation. This problem was unrelated to the core functionality but prevented initial testing.

### Issue 2: Dataclass Parameter Ordering in EventBase
The `ErrorEvent` dataclass in `events.py` had a structural issue with non-default attributes following default attributes, which violates Python's dataclass constraints. This was fixed by:
- Converting the event classes to regular classes with proper `__init__` methods
- Ensuring correct parameter ordering in initialization

## Test Results
The final test was successful and demonstrated:
- Proper service registration and resolution
- Successful event subscription
- Proper event publishing and delivery
- Correct lifecycle management (initialization and shutdown)

```

## Recommendations
1. **Fix the dataclass structure in events.py** - The core module needs to be adjusted to fix the dataclass parameter ordering issue in EventBase and its derived classes.
2. **Add more comprehensive tests** - While our test demonstrates basic functionality, more comprehensive tests would be valuable for edge cases.
3. **Fix virtual environment setup** - Create a more robust virtual environment setup process to avoid issues with dependency installation.

## Conclusion
The Phase 2 core infrastructure components are functioning as expected. The service container and event bus form a solid foundation for the application architecture. With the issues identified and fixed, the project can proceed to Phase 3.
