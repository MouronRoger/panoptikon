## Transition Date
May 15, 2025

## What Was Completed
- ‚úÖ Connection pool implementation fully tested
- ‚úÖ Critical test coverage gaps addressed
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks completed
- ‚úÖ Thread safety verified

## Key Achievements
1. Resolved the blocking issue of zero test coverage
2. Implemented comprehensive test suite for connection pooling
3. Validated thread safety with concurrent access tests
4. Established foundation for migration system

## Phase 4.3 Objectives
1. Implement automated schema versioning
2. Create forward migration execution
3. Build rollback capabilities
4. Establish migration testing framework

## Next Immediate Actions
- [ ] Design migration file format
- [ ] Create migration runner
- [ ] Implement version tracking
- [ ] Build rollback mechanism

## Notes
This transition marks a critical milestone. The connection pool, which was blocking progress due to lack of testing, is now production-ready. This provides a stable foundation for the migration system in Phase 4.3.
