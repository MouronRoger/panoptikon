# Phase 1: MVP Implementation - Verification Prompt

I need you to verify the Phase 1 MVP implementation of the Panoptikon project and prepare documentation for the transition to Phase 2.

## Verification Process

First, read the implementation documentation:

```
read_file docs/phase1_implementation.md
read_file docs/phase1_test_report.md
```

Then, perform these verification steps in sequence:

## Step 1: Code Quality Verification

Verify that all implemented code meets the project's quality standards:

1. Check code formatting:
   ```
   black --check src/panoptikon
   ```

2. Run linters to verify style conformance:
   ```
   ruff check src/panoptikon
   ```

3. Verify type annotations are complete:
   ```
   mypy src/panoptikon
   ```

4. Check docstring coverage:
   ```
   # Use the appropriate docstring coverage tool from Phase 0
   ```

## Step 2: Test Coverage Verification

Verify that test coverage meets requirements:

1. Run the test suite with coverage:
   ```
   pytest --cov=src/panoptikon tests/
   ```

2. Check specific component test coverage:
   ```
   pytest --cov=src/panoptikon/index tests/test_index
   pytest --cov=src/panoptikon/db tests/test_db
   pytest --cov=src/panoptikon/search tests/test_search
   pytest --cov=src/panoptikon/cli tests/test_cli
   ```

3. Verify minimum 80% coverage requirement is met for all modules

## Step 3: Functionality Testing

Perform functional tests to verify core requirements:

1. Test indexing functionality:
   ```
   # Create a test directory with sample files
   # Run the indexer on this directory
   # Verify files are correctly indexed
   ```

2. Test search functionality:
   ```
   # Perform search queries with different patterns
   # Verify results are accurate and complete
   # Test performance (should be <200ms for typical queries)
   ```

3. Test the CLI interface:
   ```
   # Run the CLI with various commands
   # Verify output is properly formatted
   # Test as-you-type search functionality
   ```

## Step 4: Performance Verification

Verify that the implementation meets performance requirements:

1. Test indexing speed:
   - Should process at least 1,000 files per second on reference hardware
   - Verify with large directory structures

2. Test search performance:
   - Search response time should be under 200ms for typical queries
   - Test with various database sizes to verify scaling

3. Test memory usage:
   - Monitor memory consumption during indexing and searching
   - Verify efficient resource usage

## Step 5: Requirements Validation

Validate that all Phase 1 requirements from the specification have been met:

1. File indexing and metadata collection (2.1.1, 2.1.2)
2. Basic as-you-type filename/path search (2.2.1)
3. Search performance under 200ms (3.1.1)
4. Component and DB structure (4.1.1/4.1.2)

## Step 6: Create Verification Report

Create a comprehensive verification report at `docs/phase1_verification.md` that includes:

1. Results of all verification steps
2. Code quality assessment
3. Test coverage statistics
4. Functionality verification results
5. Performance measurements
6. Requirements validation summary
7. Any issues or limitations found
8. Recommendations for improvements
9. Clear confirmation that Phase 1 is complete or list of remaining tasks

## Step 7: Prepare Phase 2 Status Document

Create a Phase 2 status document at `docs/phase2_status.md` that includes:

1. Current Phase (Phase 2: Native macOS UI)
2. Component list to be implemented:
   - PyObjC application framework
   - UI components (search field, results table, etc.)
   - File operations integration
   - Menu bar integration
3. Required features from the specification
4. Implementation guidelines for Phase 2
5. Quality expectations for the implementation

## Deliverables

The verification process must produce these deliverables:

1. `docs/phase1_verification.md` - Comprehensive verification report
2. `docs/phase2_status.md` - Status document for Phase 2

These documents are CRITICAL for continuity as they will be used by the next instance of Claude to implement Phase 2.

## Critical Verification Criteria

Focus especially on verifying these critical aspects:

1. Indexing performance meets the 1000+ files/second requirement
2. Search response time is under 200ms for typical queries
3. All core MVP functionality is implemented and working
4. Code quality and test coverage meet the established standards
5. The terminal interface provides a usable way to test the system
6. The database schema properly stores all required metadata

If any of these critical criteria are not met, the verification should fail and specify exactly what needs to be fixed before proceeding to Phase 2.
